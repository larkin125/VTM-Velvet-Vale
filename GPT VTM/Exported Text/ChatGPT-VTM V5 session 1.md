# VTM V5 session 1

**Created:** 10/22/2025 15:41:34  

### **Prelude: Whispered Invitations**

**London, 2002.**  
It rains like it always does — soft, constant, and silver on the windows of Lucian’s unassuming flat in Camden. Beneath the mundane surface lies _The Velvet Veil_, a hidden chamber of art, relics, and the scent of forgotten roses.

Word has reached the Toreador court:  
Prince **Adrian Welles**, the centuries-old ruler of London, is hosting a _private salon_ at his Elysium tonight — ostensibly to unveil a new art installation… but rumor speaks of a _power vacuum_.

The _Harpy of London_, **Marianne of Bath**, was found _staked_ in her haven three nights ago. Someone has been feeding the Prince false reports, and suspicion falls on every clan.

An invitation, written in expensive cream parchment, rests on Lucian’s piano:

> “Your taste and counsel are required, darling Lucian.  
> — A.”

### **Scene One: The Salon at Elysium**

The venue is the **National Gallery**, long closed to the public this evening.  
Candlelight flickers against oil paintings — Rembrandt, Turner, Rossetti — while Kindred mingle in murmurs and false smiles.

Prince Adrian stands near the dais, his pale hand resting on a silver-topped cane.  
The Seneschal, a Ventrue named _Elodie Rains_, approaches you first, her gaze like polished glass.

> **Elodie:** “Lucian. You grace us at last. The Prince will be _most eager_ to hear your… aesthetic insights. But between us — what did Marianne tell you before she perished? You two were… familiar.”

She’s probing. In public. A test of composure and loyalty.

* * *

"My lady Rains.." Lucian made an elegant overexagerated bow, wearing a fine open tunic shirt in the Neuve noir style, open neck and frills. tight leather trousers and knee high boots.

"It is a heartbreak the moment I heard that Lady Marianne was... you know.." He made a steaking motion into his chest. "First of all, I have not spoken to her in a few months."


* * *

Elodie Rains watches your performance with an expression that doesn’t quite reach her eyes.  
The Seneschal’s lips twitch — not a smile, but the ghost of one. Around you, the chatter of Kindred grows hushed; a few Toreador hang on your words like admirers at a salon performance.

> **Elodie:** “Mm. I see your flair for drama remains intact.”  
> She takes a step closer, voice a whisper meant for you alone.  
> “Careful, Lucian. The Prince is… disturbed by her death. And he has already tasked the _Hounds_ with finding her killer. If he suspects your silence hides something, it will not end with words.”

She brushes past, perfume faint and cold. You can feel her intent — she wanted to _warn_ you… or perhaps to see how you react when cornered.

At that moment, someone else approaches:  
A short man in a dark velvet coat, hair slicked back like oil — _Grimshaw_, your Nosferatu contact.  
He gives a subtle bow, eyes darting toward a quiet corner behind a sculpture of St. Michael.

> **Grimshaw (low voice):**  
> “Got something for you, Luci. Marianne’s last meeting wasn’t in Whitechapel like everyone says. It was in _Knightsbridge_.  
> And she wasn’t with a Brujah — she was meeting someone _from Elysium_.”

He pauses, a grin splitting his sallow face.

> “Guess who.”

* * *

Lucian looks a little offended at Elodie as he puts his hand on his chest. "My lady, you wound me with those accusations. I am a loyal servent of the Prince and the Camarilla since my introduction all those years ago. I have done nothing but be honest and open with all who come to me and those who summon me." He nodded softly.

Turning to Grimshaw, Lucian nodded and motioned. "As you see, I have pulled favours to find out what had happened, Although Whitechapel is a horrible place, Knightsbridge even more so..." He turned to the contact. "Who?"

* * *

Lovely—Lucian’s _injured dignity_ plays like music through the hall. The surrounding Kindred murmur with subtle appreciation; even Elodie seems momentarily disarmed by his gallant tone. She offers only a curt nod before drifting off to attend to another guest.

Now the spotlight narrows to you and Grimshaw, tucked behind the sculpture’s marble wings. The low buzz of the salon becomes a distant hum, the scent of candlewax and aged wine hanging between you.

* * *

Grimshaw’s eyes dart left and right before he speaks, his voice a conspiratorial rasp.

> **Grimshaw:** “Marianne met with _Sir Reginald Harker_. You know him—Keeper of Elysium, Toreador like yourself, all white gloves and quiet cruelty. The Prince trusts him more than anyone. Or used to.”

He produces a thin, leather-bound notebook, small enough to hide in a sleeve. The edges are stained with something dark.

> “Found this in Marianne’s haven. Mentions _The Rosethorn Pact._ Don’t know what that is yet, but whatever she learned got her killed.”

He glances toward the Prince’s dais.

> “You tell Welles, and he’ll tear Elysium apart looking for scapegoats. You tell Harker, and he’ll bury you under a dozen compliments and call it art. My advice? Keep your head low until you know which one’s the spider.”

He pauses, half-grinning.

> “Unless you’re feeling brave, Luci.”

* * *

"Well dont you have my balls in a vice my little impish friend." he sighed, running his hand down his face, before approaching the Prince, more pomp and elegance as he bowed

* * *

Lucian’s boots click softly on the marble as he strides through the candlelit gallery. The gathered Kindred part like curtains, watching with a mix of envy and dread as he approaches the dais.

Prince **Adrian Welles** stands before Turner’s _“The Fighting Temeraire”_, the faint glow of its golden horizon reflected in his pale eyes. A beautiful corpse admiring another. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle — too gentle.

> **Welles:** “Lucian. The rose among brambles.”  
> He turns, a faint smile ghosting his lips.  
> “Marianne’s death wounds us all. You were close to her. Tell me… do you mourn her as I do?”

He gestures for you to rise. The Seneschal, Elodie, lingers just out of earshot — clearly watching.

Now is your moment. You can **present the notebook** and shape the narrative.

* * *

"She will be missed, my Prince. I was fond of her, she had an air and perfume that I much enjoyed being around. Plus, her tits were to die for." He chuckled softly to himself.

"I... I am torn my Prince. A contact of mine whom I sent to investigate upon hearing the act, found something that would put me at a disadvantage to all sides. I fear for my safety, not from you my Prince, you are as ever, a graceful and honrouable patron.. " He bowed again. "But I am fearful of those who did this to our dearest Marianne. If I may, I wish to approach and bring this to your attention, without the prying eyes of those around."

The humor cuts through the tension like a fine edge — daring, irreverent, _Toreador to the bone_.  
The Prince’s expression doesn’t change at first, but a corner of his mouth betrays the faintest ghost of amusement. A ripple of whispers passes through the court — Lucian always did dance on knives.

Welles raises a pale hand, and immediately, the chatter dies. The room grows so silent you can hear the rain tapping against the gallery’s grand windows.

> **Welles:** “Very well, Lucian. Let us step aside.”  
> His voice is soft but heavy, carrying the kind of command that brooks no refusal.

He gestures toward a curtained alcove — a private annex lined with portraits of mortal nobles long dead. Once inside, the velvet curtains close behind you, muting the outside world. The Prince turns, his eyes sharp now, the veneer of charm fading into something ancient.

> **Welles:** “Show me.”

* * *

You remove the notebook, holding it delicately as if it might crumble. Its worn leather glints in the flickering light.

The Prince accepts it carefully, opening to the page marked by a torn ribbon — _The Rosethorn Pact_. His brows knit slightly.

> **Welles:** “This… name. I have not heard it in decades.”  
> He looks up, meeting your gaze.  
> “You were wise to bring this to me. But tell me — who gave you this?”

You feel the weight of the question. His voice is calm, but there’s an _edge_, like the hush before a predator’s lunge. Grimshaw’s name burns at the back of your throat — valuable, but dangerous.

"A contact of mine found it in her belongings.. He is, well.. not one for the glamour of the light. If you catch my drift..."

* * *

Welles studies you for several long seconds. The candlelight catches his eyes — ancient, cold, and strangely… amused.

> **Welles:** “Ah. The shadows speak to you, then.”  
> He closes the notebook slowly, fingers tapping its cover as if testing the rhythm of a waltz.  
> “That pleases me. The Camarilla needs those who listen to whispers, not those who shout them.”

He takes a half-step closer, lowering his voice to something confidential — almost intimate.

> **Welles:** “You have done well, Lucian. If this _Rosethorn Pact_ stirs again, I want you to be my eyes and my voice in that dark. Bring me what you find. Quietly.”  
> “In return…” he glances toward the curtain, where Elodie waits like a statue, “…I will see that you are protected from whatever wolves stalk this court.”

He places the notebook into his coat. The moment feels sealed, heavy with unseen consequence.

Then, with the faintest smile:

> **Welles:** “Tell me, my rose — do you trust Sir Reginald Harker?”

* * *

You realize this is _not idle curiosity_. The Prince is measuring you.  
He knows you’ve already considered the possibility.

This is the pivotal point — your words will shape how Welles moves next: whether Harker becomes an ally, an enemy, or a target.

* * *

He pauses, thinking for a moment.

"I have not had the pleasure of his courtie but I have heard about him. And the rumours in the circles of his actions. I honestly have no opinion on him as of yet my Prince."


* * *

Welles regards you for a long moment, his stillness unnerving. Then, slowly, the Prince’s expression softens — the faintest curl of a satisfied smile.

> **Welles:** “Spoken like a true servant of the Camarilla. A man of reason amid a sea of passion.”  
> He steps closer, lowering his tone so only you can hear.  
> “Hold to that composure, Lucian. The nights ahead will tempt you to passion — and in passion, the Toreador are at their weakest.”

He reaches into his coat and produces a small, folded card of thick, cream parchment. The Prince’s personal seal — black wax embossed with a rose and crown.

> **Welles:** “Take this. Present it to my Herald should you require sanctuary, or should anyone question your place in this court. You have done me a service tonight.”

He looks toward the curtain.

> “Now go, my rose. Enjoy the music. And keep your eyes open. Harker will not rest easy when he learns his name passed through your lips — even so gently.”

With that, he turns away, leaving you with the faint scent of sandalwood and old paper.

* * *
Back in the main hall, the atmosphere has shifted — murmurs ripple through the gathered Kindred. You notice Sir Reginald Harker himself standing by the piano, surrounded by lesser Toreador. He raises a glass of dark vitae toward you, a sly smile touching his lips.

You’ve barely taken three steps when Grimshaw sidles back up beside you, whispering low:

> **Grimshaw:** “You did it, didn’t you? Whatever you said, the Prince’s pet ghoul just left Elysium in a hurry. Looks like someone’s about to get _visited_.”  
> He smirks. “So, what now, Luci? You going to let the old man’s hounds handle it, or dig deeper yourself before the trail’s cold?”

* * *

Taking his hand as the card is handed, Lucian kisses it gently; a loving kiss. A submissive kiss. One that had been shared many years ago on warm nights with a fledgling soon to be Prince and the artist before him.

"Yes my Prince. "

returning, he takes a glass of blood and downs it in one, not able to even take the time to savour it.  Raising the empty glass to Sir Reginald.

Looking to grimshaw, he sighs.

"I'm going to do what my Prince requires. I am going into the den of lions as a little lamb. I know sir Reginald has a thing for those of my... appearance and virvor.. We will bed, and we will talk against the pillow, as all do."

* * *

Grimshaw huffs out a low, wet laugh — the sound of a gutter-born man genuinely impressed.

> **Grimshaw:** “You mad, shining bastard. You’re going to let the spider wrap you up and call it art.”  
> He glances around, lowers his voice. “Fine. I’ll keep an ear to the sewers. If the hounds start sniffin’ too close, I’ll send word. You just… don’t get eaten.”

He melts back into the crowd, swallowed by marble and shadow.

You make your way across the gallery. Harker is waiting — immaculate as a statue, one hand resting on a cane that’s more ornament than support. His gaze follows you, appreciative in the way collectors study paintings they already own.

> **Harker:** “Lucian. The Prince’s favorite pet graces my corner.  
> You’ve been avoiding me, haven’t you? I do hope it’s not fear.”

He steps closer, voice dropping to a purr.

> **Harker:** “You look… exquisite tonight. Come — drink with me. I insist.”

He gestures toward a secluded lounge where the candles burn lower and the whispers sound like sighs. The table glitters with crystal and silver, and the air smells faintly of rosewater and blood.

You sit. The dance begins.

**Harker** leans forward, eyes glittering.

> **Harker:** “They say you brought something interesting to our Prince.  
> You wouldn’t happen to know what that might be, would you?”

He smiles, thin and knowing — the smile of a man who already suspects, and is waiting to see how gracefully you lie.

* * *

"No far at all My Lord Sire." Lucian bows and curtsies. Taking his hand and kissing it softly.

"I've just been so gathered with so much work in the painters alley that I've been unable to be torn away from the muses." He chuckled softly.  The tone, the voice, the purr, the sly hand slipped down the back of his trousers to prod his opening with a single finger..

Intent, he all but knew.

"Ofcourse my lord sire.. I wouldn't think of anything I'd want to do more." He gasped softly, following him into the lounge and sitting beside him.

Leg crossed, one hanging over Harker's leg, Lucian pressed up against Harker, he spoke softly, playing with the older's hair with an eblow  on the sofa back behind him.

"There was the death of one of a close friends of ours... he asked if I knew anything. An old contact of mine brought me a letter he found, to some Nosferatu working for the Anarchists..." He lied, half lied.

"The Prince is going to search there way." He sighed, a needy husky submissive sigh as he sipped the blood in the wine glass

* * *

The lounge feels smaller than it is.  

The air is perfumed with dust, velvet, and vitae. Harker allows the nearness — even encourages it — a faint smirk curling his mouth as Lucian’s charm bleeds into the moment. For the Toreador, proximity is conversation; the body is punctuation.

> **Harker:** “Ah… the muses. They are such jealous lovers.”  
> His fingers trace the rim of his glass.  
> “You do them justice, Lucian. Even your lies are painted beautifully.”

He tilts his head, eyes narrowing in faint amusement.

> **Harker:** “So the Prince sends his hounds to the sewers. Convenient. Keeps his gaze away from the gallery, doesn’t it?”

A pause. The mask slips — just a flicker, but Lucian sees it: the tiniest tightening of the jaw, a ripple of irritation that he hides behind a smile.

> **Harker:** “Tell me, my dear, did your… contact happen to mention what this _letter_ said? Or did you leave that part out to make me chase it from your lips?”

The question is bait. You can feel it. He’s not sure what you know — but he’s fishing, testing whether the Prince told you anything real.  
The wine-dark candlelight glints across his signet ring — engraved with a _thorned rose_.

* * *

With their lips almost close, faces so close as if to kiss, but not... The two sat there, Lucian pressed against him like a good submissive toy.

"I did not read it. The Prince's dog summoned me. I dont get involved in the court's dealings. I am just an archivist, collector, painter and... lover.."

* * *

The line lands softly, but it hits its mark.  
Harker’s eyes stay on yours a long moment — weighing, measuring, wondering whether to believe the meekness or enjoy it. He lets the pause stretch until it hums.

> **Harker:** “A lover… and yet, you find yourself in the centre of a Prince’s investigation.”  
> He smiles faintly. “That, my dear Lucian, is why I adore artists. You pretend not to play the game, and still, you always end up on the stage.”

He straightens, the air cooling between you. The mask returns, voice smooth once more.

> **Harker:** “Keep to your paints for now. If His Grace asks, tell him that I am as loyal as ever. You may even tell him I toasted to Marianne’s memory tonight.”  
> His smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “And if the _Rosethorn_ nonsense resurfaces again, come to me first. We mustn’t trouble the Prince with rumours.”

He stands, adjusts his cuffs, then glances back down at you.

> **Harker:** “You wear obedience beautifully, Lucian. But remember—submission can be a kind of art, too. Practise it wisely.”

He leaves you in the low light, the sound of the chamber orchestra drifting faintly from the gallery beyond.  
On the table beside his half-empty glass lies something he must have meant you to notice: a small pressed rose, its petals darkened to near black and pricked through with a silver pin.

Grimshaw appears a few minutes later, lurking in the doorway, eyes darting between you and the abandoned flower.

> **Grimshaw:** “Well? You live. That’s somethin’. What’s that he left ya?”

* * *

Hearing the Rosethorn word, he almost coughed at it, but kept his face submissivly passive.

"Ofcourse.. my lord sire.." He said softly, slowly sliding down the sofa until he was on his knee's between the Lord's legs. A sharp nailed hand running through his silvery white hair.

*Fade to black*

After Harker had left the alchove; Lucian sprawled on the leather sofa in the quiet slcohove, Using a paper fan to cool himself down, 

"Shut up you disgusting rat." Lucian's mask dropped for once. He picked up the glass rose, inspecting it close as he pinned it to his lapel.

"Its a whore bitches collar. To tell the world who's bitch I am." He growled. "What do you want.."

## Response:
You can almost hear the gallery again now that Harker’s presence is gone—the faint scrape of a bow across strings, the hush of other conversations resuming once the Prince’s Keeper has taken his leave.

Grimshaw steps a little further inside. He’s still smiling, but it’s the kind of grin that hides nerves rather than delight.

> **Grimshaw:** “Easy, Luci. You still got both eyes and a heartbeat—undead as it is. That’s a win in my book.”

He gestures with a stubby finger toward the pinned rose.

> **Grimshaw:** “That thing’s got teeth, though. You feel it? There’s a symbol etched on the pin—tiny, under the clasp. Old sigil the Nosferatu trade around; it means _property of the Rosethorn_. Marianne had one in her haven too, same metal. Whoever wears it’s marked as belonging to the Pact, or claimed by it.”

He crouches beside the couch, voice dropping lower.

> **Grimshaw:** “You just got drafted into their little club, whether you like it or not. Question is: you gonna wear the leash and see where it leads, or cut it off before they start tugging?”

He straightens, waiting, his expression halfway between admiration and worry.

* * *

"The man just fucked me, used me and told me in no uncertain terms I'm his bitch, and that he is involved. THIS is exactly what you said it is. And its not your business to know what I do with it." He growled. "And you'll probably sell this information to anyone who asks or pays you enough." He sighed, standing up, pulling up his trousers and fastening his belt, brushing his fingers through his hair and checking his stained self in the reflection of a nearby picture frame.

"The Prince was a brother to me, a lover, one of my closest companions. I serve him, but this.." He flicked the rose. "Is all part of serving my Prince. I have to play both sides."

Grimshaw lifts both hands, palms out, the smirk fading.

> **Grimshaw:** “Easy, easy. You don’t owe me your soul, Luci. You’re right—I deal in whispers, not faith. But I ain’t stupid enough to sell a rumour that’s got the Prince and Harker both stitched into it.”

He waits while you straighten yourself, eyes flicking toward the curtained doorway.

> **Grimshaw:** “All right. You play the pretty pawn. Just remember pawns bleed first when the board flips.”

He hesitates, then adds quietly:

> **Grimshaw:** “If you need to pass something to Welles without anyone seein’ you together, leave it at the old tube station in Camden Town. The one they never reopened after the Blitz. I’ll make sure it reaches him.”

He melts back toward the shadows, voice dropping to a rasp.

> **Grimshaw:** “Watch Harker’s temper. The man collects people the way you collect paintings. And when he gets bored…”

The rest is lost in the din of the gallery as he disappears.

* * *

Lucian is alone again. The faint strings of the orchestra drift through the curtains. Outside this little alcove, the Elysium’s glittering court has resumed its dance—none of them yet realising that the game has changed.

The rose on your lapel catches the light, a small glint of silver and black.

You’ve gained:

*   The Prince’s favour — protection and access.
*   Harker’s mark — leverage and danger.
*   Grimshaw’s channel — a way to move in the dark unseen.

He threw the empty glass at the cloth curtain covering the door to get Grimshaw to leave.

With a sigh, he goes home.

* * *

The glass hits the curtain with a sharp, hollow clink, rolls across the marble, and disappears into the folds. The sound is enough; you hear Grimshaw’s boots scuff once, then fade completely.

### **Epilogue: The Velvet Veil**

Outside, London’s rain has turned from mist to a steady downpour.  
The streets are slick mirrors of sodium light. By the time Lucian reaches his building in Camden, the night smells of wet stone and paint thinner — the scent of his own exile.

Inside, _The Velvet Veil_ waits just as he left it: canvases leaning against walls, half-finished studies of faces he can’t quite forget. The only sound is the soft ticking of an antique clock and the occasional sigh of pipes behind the plaster.

He peels off the damp shirt, hangs the coat where it always hangs. The rose glints faintly in the mirror, the tiny silver pin catching the room’s lone bulb. A reminder. A claim.

For a moment, Lucian’s reflection looks like the boy who once knelt before a fledgling artist turned Prince, full of hope and devotion. Then the illusion breaks, leaving only the pale creature with too many debts and not enough time to pay them.

He pours himself another glass, this time not pretending to taste it.  
The city hums below — its heartbeat slow and secret.

* * *

### **Session Summary — “The Velvet Veil, Part I”**

*   **Allies:**
    *   _Prince Adrian Welles_ — trusts you, for now. You hold his personal seal.
    *   _Grimshaw (Nosferatu)_ — wary ally, courier of secrets.
*   **Enemies / Dangers:**
    *   _Sir Reginald Harker_ — Keeper of Elysium, probable member of the Rosethorn Pact. Has “marked” you as his.
    *   The _Rosethorn Pact_ — unknown purpose, tied to Marianne’s death.
*   **Current Status:**
    *   You are walking a double line between the Prince and Harker.
