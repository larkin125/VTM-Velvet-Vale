A student under [[Lucian Valemont]]. Became his Ghoul in Session 2

### **Adrian Vale**

**Age:** 24  
**Mortal Occupation:** Postgraduate Literature Student, King’s College London  
**Background:** Born in Bath, raised in a quiet academic family. His father a historian, his mother a painter of modest repute. Adrian grew up in old houses filled with books, portraits, and dust motes — the sort of world where silence itself feels curated.

**Appearance:**  
Adrian carries a fragile sort of beauty — pale skin touched by sleeplessness, soft dark hair that never sits quite right, and eyes of deep grey that seem to drink in the world rather than look at it. His clothes are unassuming but thoughtful: charcoal coats, scarves even when not needed, a faint trace of ink on his fingers. His posture is composed yet uncertain, as if he’s still learning how to inhabit his own body.

When Lucien first sees him, there’s something _familiar_ about him — the kind of youth Lucien once was: romantic, observant, a little haunted by beauty.

---

**Personality:**  
Curious. Earnest. Too clever for his own good. Adrian is drawn to old things — books that smell of damp paper, poetry that aches with longing, men who carry the weight of centuries in their gaze. Beneath his intellect lies loneliness — a longing to belong somewhere that feels _real._

He speaks softly, listens intently, and asks questions that unsettle rather than flatter. When he talks about art or literature, it’s with reverence — but when he talks to Lucien, there’s a tremor of awe, as though he senses the predator behind the poet.

**Connection to Lucien:**  
Adrian visits _The Velvet Veil_ archive while researching 19th-century vampire symbolism in Romantic literature. Lucien, intrigued by his insight and resemblance to a long-lost muse, begins to feed him knowledge — and eventually, blood. Their connection grows from mentorship to obsession: Adrian sees Lucien as both subject and story, and Lucien sees in Adrian a reflection of the youth he lost.

To Lucien, Adrian Vale becomes _the living canvas_ — a fragile mortal touched by art, desire, and the slow corrosion of eternity.
