Vale","icon":"","description":"A student under <a data-href=\"Lucian Valemont\" href=\"characters/lucian-valemont.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucian Valemont</a>. Became his Ghoul in Session 2Age: 24\nMortal Occupation: Postgraduate Literature Student, King’s College London\nBackground: Born in Bath, raised in a quiet academic family. His father a historian, his mother a painter of modest repute. Adrian grew up in old houses filled with books, portraits, and dust motes — the sort of world where silence itself feels curated.Appearance:\nAdrian carries a fragile sort of beauty — pale skin touched by sleeplessness, soft dark hair that never sits quite right, and eyes of deep grey that seem to drink in the world rather than look at it. His clothes are unassuming but thoughtful: charcoal coats, scarves even when not needed, a faint trace of ink on his fingers. His posture is composed yet uncertain, as if he’s still learning how to inhabit his own body.When Lucien first sees him, there’s something familiar about him — the kind of youth Lucien once was: romantic, observant, a little haunted by beauty.Personality:\nCurious. Earnest. Too clever for his own good. Adrian is drawn to old things — books that smell of damp paper, poetry that aches with longing, men who carry the weight of centuries in their gaze. Beneath his intellect lies loneliness — a longing to belong somewhere that feels real.He speaks softly, listens intently, and asks questions that unsettle rather than flatter. When he talks about art or literature, it’s with reverence — but when he talks to Lucien, there’s a tremor of awe, as though he senses the predator behind the poet.Connection to Lucien:\nAdrian visits The Velvet Veil archive while researching 19th-century vampire symbolism in Romantic literature. Lucien, intrigued by his insight and resemblance to a long-lost muse, begins to feed him knowledge — and eventually, blood. Their connection grows from mentorship to obsession: Adrian sees Lucien as both subject and story, and Lucien sees in Adrian a reflection of the youth he lost.To Lucien, Adrian Vale becomes the living canvas — a fragile mortal touched by art, desire, and the slow corrosion of eternity.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>Adrian Vale</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Adrian_Vale**_0"}],"links":["characters/lucian-valemont.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"characters/adrian-vale.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761750204159,"modifiedTime":1761756768031,"sourceSize":2193,"sourcePath":"Characters/Adrian Vale.md","exportPath":"characters/adrian-vale.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":11,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"characters/adrian-welles.html":{"title":"Adrian Welles","icon":"","description":"Prince of the <a data-href=\"London\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">London</a> <a data-href=\"The Camarilla\" href=\"organisations/the-camarilla.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Camarilla</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[".html","organisations/the-camarilla.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"characters/adrian-welles.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761749470328,"modifiedTime":1761749484927,"sourceSize":42,"sourcePath":"Characters/Adrian Welles.md","exportPath":"characters/adrian-welles.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":2,"backlinks":["characters/elodie-rains.html","characters/lucian-valemont.html"],"type":"markdown"},"characters/adrien-valemont.html":{"title":"Adrien Valemont","icon":"","description":"Sire to <a data-href=\"Lucian Valemont\" href=\"characters/lucian-valemont.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucian Valemont</a><br>Killed by <a data-href=\"Lucian Valemont\" href=\"characters/lucian-valemont.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucian Valemont</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["characters/lucian-valemont.html","characters/lucian-valemont.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"characters/adrien-valemont.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761749427557,"modifiedTime":1761756784031,"sourceSize":60,"sourcePath":"Characters/Adrien Valemont.md","exportPath":"characters/adrien-valemont.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":13,"backlinks":["characters/lucian-valemont.html","items/the-rosethorn-folio.html"],"type":"markdown"},"characters/dr.-sebastian-crowe.html":{"title":"Dr. Sebastian Crowe","icon":"","description":"Curator of <a data-href=\"The Victoria &amp;

Instead of punishment, Lucien was summoned. Lord Valemont saw in him something exquisite — a living muse, a sculpture of hunger and grace yet unformed.The Embrace\nThe Lord grew infatuated, blurring the lines between patron, artist, and lover. When Lucien reached his twenty-first year, Valemont whispered, “You are too perfect to fade.”\nThat night, Lucien died upon satin sheets and awoke into the Requiem — reborn by his master’s hand, not as a man, but as a masterpiece.Valemont shaped him as one might a statue: taught him the arts, the poise, the secrets of blood and brush. Yet like all art, Lucien outgrew his maker. Over decades, he came to see Valemont’s love as possession — beauty caged, desire gilded.In 1910, during the fire that consumed the Valemont Estate, Lucien disappeared into the night. The ashes of his master were found in the marble gallery, a smile painted upon his lips.Modern Nights (Present)\nNow, Lucien Valemont lives again — an immortal aesthete in the modern age, a “modern Rasputin” whose salons blur the line between enlightenment and ecstasy.\nHis haven, The Crimson Salon, is an opulent labyrinth of books, art, and pleasure. Mortals and Kindred alike gather there — poets, occultists, models, sinners — all drawn to Lucien’s promise:\n“To be remembered is to be eternal. Come, and let me paint your soul.”\nHe curates his collection of forbidden books and occult tomes, forever chasing the same question that haunted his sire — can art transcend death, or must it consume life to do so?🌹 Lucien Valemont, Caretaker of the RosethornClan: Toreador\nSire: Lord Adrien Valemont (deceased)\nTitle: The Caretaker of the Heart\nCurrent Domain: Harker Estate, London\nChronicle: Velvet Veil – The Thorns Beneath the Rose🕯️ Current StatusFollowing the death of Sir Reginald Harker and the revelations surrounding the Rosethorn Pact, Lucien Valemont assumed guardianship of the Heart and the Roses Below — the pulsing, vitae-fed roots that bind the covenant’s original oath.He does not command their power; instead, he tends to it — a penitent keeper, chosen (or cursed) to ensure the roses never fall into the hands of those who would misuse them.Each night, Lucien walks the catacombs beneath the estate — a labyrinth of brick and bone where roses bloom from walls slick with vitae.To keep them alive, he must feed them: sacrifices offered in silence, The roses whisper to him, echoing the voices of those consumed — his court of ghosts and blossoms.He paints their faces to remember them.🩸 The PenanceAt the Prince’s command, Lucien accepted a Penance Eternal. His art must now be service, his beauty a burden.In secret, he disobeys only one part of that vow: he keeps the painting — The Heart Beneath the Rose — sealed within the Velvet Veil.\nHe tells no one that it still breathes.🌹 The Rosethorn’s NatureThe Heart is not a metaphor. It is literal — a fleshy mass of vitae and root, the remnant of the First Toreador’s Heart, interwoven with thorns, pulsing faintly in the dark.\nThe Roses bloom from it, white as wax, red at the tips.\nThey thirst. They remember. They sing.Lucien’s duty is to keep their song quiet — and their hunger sated.🩸 The Penance of the RosesTo keep the roses alive, Lucien must feed them life itself. The roots beneath the Harker Estate crave breath, warmth, and the pulse of a living heart.In the catacombs below, iron reliquaries line the walls , shaped like sarcophagi, grim devices from another age, waiting in the depths beneath the Harker Estate. Within them, the vines twist and bloom, feeding not from the ground but from the warmth of the living. Those brought below are never seen again; their bodies vanish into the growth, leaving only faint echoes of voices that murmur through the petals at night.Lucien did not build them. They were already there when he inherited the duty; remnants of an ancient design meant to sustain the Heart below. He merely continues the ritual, because without it the roses would wither, and the Heart he protects would perish with them.Each offering is chosen carefully, sometimes drawn by his charm, sometimes by promise, sometimes by fate. When the hour comes, Lucien descends alone. He does not flee or turn away. He waits in the silence of the chamber, head bowed, until the last whisper fades and the roses have taken what they require. It is not cruelty that holds him there but contrition; a penance willingly endured.He paints each face afterwards, records each name. The portraits line the walls of the Velvet Veil, mute witnesses to the price of preservation.

Every few centuries, the Pact seeks to “renew” itself by pulling in new Kindred whose vitae resonates with the original lovers’ lineage or ideals. Each of the Thirteen Thorns holds one vote within the Pact’s tribunal. These votes, when combined, allow the Pact to override Camarilla decrees or enforce blood edicts within the sect’s understructure. To outsiders, it looks like a secret political cabal.

The “Pact” is feeding off every drop of vitae spilled in London since its founding — it’s already blooming beneath the city. Lucien must decide:\nDestroy the Pact, damning the souls of all bound to it — including his own Sire’s memory.\nUsurp Harker, drink the chalice himself, becoming the Thirteenth Bloom.\nFeed it to the

Inside, one phrase repeats: “<a data-href=\"The Rosethorn Pact\" href=\"organisations/the-rosethorn-pact.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Rosethorn Pact</a>”Lucian presents the notebook to Prince Welles in private, masking his fear with devotion. The Prince is intrigued, remembering the name Rosethorn from decades past. He tasks Lucian to quietly watch for any sign of the Pact, entrusting him with his personal seal of protection and warning him that Harker will not take kindly to such knowledge.Lucian leaves the Prince’s alcove under the watchful eyes of the court — and Harker himself.<br>Lucian accepts Harker’s invitation to a secluded lounge within <a data-href=\"Elysium\" href=\"locations/elysium.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Elysium</a>. What follows is a conversation laced with manipulation, attraction, and power. Lucian submits outwardly, using intimacy as his weapon. Harker probes for information about what Lucian told the Prince; Lucian gives him only fragments and half-truths.When the meeting ends, Harker leaves behind a token — a black pressed rose pierced with a silver pin.Grimshaw later identifies it as a mark of belonging to the Rosethorn Pact — a symbol worn by Marianne before her death. Lucian understands the implication: he’s now publicly claimed as one of Harker’s possessions.<br>Lucian returns home through the wet streets of <a data-href=\"Camden\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Camden</a>. The rain on the windowpanes echoes the rhythm of his heartbeat. He stands before his mirror, staring at the rose on his lapel — both collar and key.He realizes the truth of his position:\nHe must serve two masters — the Prince who once loved him and the Keeper who now owns him — while walking the razor edge between their secrets.As the city hums below, Lucian swears to himself that he’ll play both sides until he can cut the strings from them all.Allies:\n<br>Prince <a data-href=\"Adrian Welles\" href=\"characters/adrian-welles.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adrian Welles</a>: trusts Lucian; granted him personal protection. <br><a data-href=\"Grimshaw\" href=\"characters/grimshaw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Grimshaw</a> (Nosferatu): wary but loyal informant; manages secret communications.

His ghoul, <a data-href=\"Evelyn\" href=\"characters/evelyn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Evelyn</a>, brought him news of a delivery—an intended vessel for his hunger—but Lucian, weary of mind and spirit, refused to feed on a stranger. The act of restraint foreshadowed the moral and emotional conflict that would define the night.<br>Later, a willing donor— <a data-href=\"Adrian Vale\" href=\"characters/adrian-vale.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adrian Vale</a>, the Student, one of Lucian’s regulars—was brought to the library. Their interaction began as an intellectual exchange on Victorian vampiric myth and ended as a dark reflection of Lucian’s own past, as he revealed himself and fed. The feeding was intimate but controlled, reaffirming his humanity rather than eroding it. The Student, enthralled and awed, became Lucian’s new ghoul, marked with his personal sigil.Afterward, Lucian painted the youth as he slept—an act of creation and sin intertwined—and sealed his hunger in colour and canvas.<br>The following evening, Lucian descended into London’s museum sub-basement, where he met <a data-href=\"Dr. Sebastian Crowe\" href=\"characters/dr.-sebastian-crowe.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dr. Sebastian Crowe</a>, the Curator of <a data-href=\"The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum\" href=\"locations/the-victoria-&amp;-albert-museum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a> and recovered <a data-href=\"The Rosethorn Folio\" href=\"items/the-rosethorn-folio.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Rosethorn Folio</a>, a set of three vellum pages bearing the signatures of long-dead (and still-undead) aristocrats, including his own and that of his former master, <a data-href=\"Sir Reginald Harker\" href=\"characters/sir-reginald-harker.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sir Reginald Harker</a>. The tense exchange was interrupted by the arrival of <a data-href=\"Elias Crane\" href=\"characters/elias-crane.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Elias Crane</a>, an agent of Harker’s, resulting in a standoff of old powers. Through cunning and the invocation of his lineage, Lucian claimed legal and personal ownership of the artefact.<br>Back home, he faced Sir Reginald himself, whose visit turned into a familiar but fraught power game. Their relationship—part devotion, part manipulation—culminated in a reminder of the elder’s control and a warning about the Rosethorn’s origins.

Adrian discovered that Lucian’s name was written among the founders—added hastily, on the same night of his Embrace by Lord Adrian Valemont, his sire. Lucian confessed that he had no memory of joining the Pact, realizing that his transformation and the Pact’s creation were intertwined.Tensions rose when Adrian questioned Lucian’s humanity and the nature of the Beast. Lucian lashed out, then immediately regretted it—embracing the boy and apologizing. Their bond deepened as master and ghoul, but Lucian’s admission of what he might do to Adrian—\"I will probably use you, like my sire used me\"—cast a shadow over their closeness.After sending Adrian away in a moment of anger, Lucian destroyed his unfinished painting in a violent outburst—tearing the canvas and shattering a wine glass against it. Evelyn arrived to find the aftermath, calm and resolute as ever. Lucian, shaken by his own rage, confessed his remorse and created something new: from glass, blood, and torn canvas, he rebuilt the painting into a luminous portrait of Evelyn, a mosaic of devotion born from ruin.He presented it to her the following morning. The refracted light made her likeness seem alive—an act of both apology and love. Evelyn, moved and uncertain, accepted the piece, sensing that it was more than art; it was confession. Their exchange reaffirmed their bond and revealed the fragile humanity that still lingered within him.In the quiet after, Lucian confided in Evelyn about Marianne of Bath, who had chosen death—her own ghoul staking her at her request—to escape the Pact. He feared he was walking the same path unknowingly, caught between the secret war of Prince Adrian Welles and Sir Reginald Harker. Evelyn warned him that he might not have joined the Pact by choice, but had been placed within it by design—that his Embrace and the Pact’s founding were one and the same event.Lucian admitted his dread of being forced to kill again, hinting at a past he never spoke of. Evelyn and Adrian vowed to protect him, forming a true Coterie within The Velvet Veil. They began to plan their next moves—Evelyn to secure the house and handle politics; Adrian to investigate Grimshaw and the museum records. Together, they agreed to uncover the Pact’s origins before Harker or the Prince moved against them.Lucian spent the following days secluded in his deepest library, recording his findings in a leather-bound journal written in his personal cipher. His body weakened with hunger until, after several sleepless nights, he finally gave in—drinking bottled blood straight from the necks, mocking his own loss of refinement.He bathed, dressed in elegance once more, and resolved to face London anew. Restored in both spirit and resolve, he prepared to attend Elysium, intent on drawing out Harker and the Prince alike through charm and deceit. For the first time in weeks, Lucian allowed himself a flicker of satisfaction—his hunger quieted, his purpose clear.Allies Strengthened:\nEvelyn Crowe: reaffirmed loyalty through compassion and practical counsel.\nAdrian Vale: elevated to true confidant and researcher within Lucian’s private circle.\nMysteries Deepened:\nLucian’s signature predates his memory—his Embrace and the Pact’s founding are linked.\nMarianne’s death was deliberate, a possible attempt to break the Rosethorn’s hold.\nThe Pact’s influence appears to bind its members across centuries.\nLucian’s Standing:\nRenewed his confidence and artistry through creation.\nNow aware he may be a keystone within the Rosethorn’s structure.\nPreparing to confront both Prince Welles and Sir Reginald Harker—each believing him loyal.

Lucien attended wearing the black rose badge — the symbol of the Rosethorn Pact — and immediately drew the attention of his enigmatic host. Harker spoke cryptically of the rose’s power, hinting that it awakened something within its bearer.During the event, Lucien mingled with guests, playing the charming artist while subtly investigating the Pact. A conversation with Lady Marie revealed that the rose was more than ornamentation — it was a relic of an ancient covenant known as The Thorns, marking chosen Kindred bound to an ancient and terrible purpose. Marie warned him that Harker’s soirées were less social events and more harvests for the Pact.Harker later confronted Lucien privately, the tension between patron and protégé erupting into violence when Lucien refused to submit to his control. After a desperate struggle and a failed attempt to resist Harker’s forced blood bond, Lucien was subdued and imprisoned beneath the estate, treated like a disobedient pet and left to starve. Despite the humiliation, he maintained his resolve — cleaning himself, preserving dignity, and secretly plotting.Weeks passed. Through the rose, Lucien began hearing whispers from other captives in the underground “garden.” He learned of The Heart, a living mass of blood-fed roots sustained by the vitae of imprisoned Kindred — Harker’s true obsession. The rose linked them all, forming a network of blood and will.Feigning submission, Lucien won Harker’s trust once more and was taken to the Garden — a cavernous, rose-filled chamber beneath the mansion. There, Harker revealed his intent to use the roses to merge with the essence of the First Sire and achieve a form of divine perfection. Lucien played the obedient lover one final time, begging for a kiss “so that if I die, I die remembering our love.” When Harker embraced him, Lucien whispered, “For Marianne,” and cast him into the Heart.Harker was consumed by his own creation — not destroyed, but absorbed. The Garden fell silent, then attuned itself to Lucien. In the aftermath, he commanded the guards, claimed the estate, and proclaimed himself Master of the Rosethorn Pact.Returning to the surface, Lucien took control of the Harker household, showing mercy to those who served under the old regime. With Evelyn’s guidance, he lied to the Prince — his friend Adrian Vale — claiming Harker had perished through his own forbidden experiments. Adrian spared Lucien, ordering him to destroy what remained of the Pact.Lucien vowed obedience.\nBut privately, he chose defiance.He would not destroy the Garden.\nHe would learn from it — and one day, use its power when the Prince needed him most.Session Outcome:\nSir Reginald Harker: Destroyed/consumed by the Garden.\nLucien Valemont: Survived, now Lord of the Harker Estate.\nThe Rosethorn Pact: Bound to Lucien through the rose.\nThe Prince (Adrian Vale): Deceived, believing the threat ended.\nEvelyn: Loyal and protective, Lucien’s sole confidante.\nStatus: The Garden sleeps beneath London, its Heart now beating in rhythm with Lucien’s own.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>Session Summary</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Session_Summary**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"gpt-vtm/1.-the-rosethorn-pact-summaries/session-4-summary.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761825294942,"modifiedTime":1761826086893,"sourceSize":3503,"sourcePath":"GPT VTM/1.

Beneath the mundane surface lies The Velvet Veil, a hidden chamber of art, relics, and the scent of forgotten roses.Word has reached the Toreador court:\nPrince Adrian Welles, the centuries-old ruler of London, is hosting a private salon at his Elysium tonight — ostensibly to unveil a new art installation… but rumor speaks of a power vacuum.The Harpy of London, Marianne of Bath, was found staked in her haven three nights ago. Someone has been feeding the Prince false reports, and suspicion falls on every clan.An invitation, written in expensive cream parchment, rests on Lucian’s piano:\n“Your taste and counsel are required, darling Lucian.\n— A.”\nThe venue is the National Gallery, long closed to the public this evening.\nCandlelight flickers against oil paintings — Rembrandt, Turner, Rossetti — while Kindred mingle in murmurs and false smiles.Prince Adrian stands near the dais, his pale hand resting on a silver-topped cane.\nThe Seneschal, a Ventrue named Elodie Rains, approaches you first, her gaze like polished glass.\nElodie: “Lucian. You grace us at last. The Prince will be most eager to hear your… aesthetic insights. But between us — what did Marianne tell you before she perished? You two were… familiar.”\nShe’s probing. In public. A test of composure and loyalty.\"My lady Rains..\" Lucian made an elegant overexagerated bow, wearing a fine open tunic shirt in the Neuve noir style, open neck and frills. tight leather trousers and knee high boots.\"It is a heartbreak the moment I heard that Lady Marianne was... you know..\" He made a steaking motion into his chest. \"First of all, I have not spoken to her in a few months.\"Elodie Rains watches your performance with an expression that doesn’t quite reach her eyes.\nThe Seneschal’s lips twitch — not a smile, but the ghost of one. Around you, the chatter of Kindred grows hushed; a few Toreador hang on your words like admirers at a salon performance.\nElodie: “Mm. I see your flair for drama remains intact.”\nShe takes a step closer, voice a whisper meant for you alone.\n“Careful, Lucian. The Prince is… disturbed by her death. And he has already tasked the Hounds with finding her killer. If he suspects your silence hides something, it will not end with words.”\nShe brushes past, perfume faint and cold. You can feel her intent — she wanted to warn you… or perhaps to see how you react when cornered.At that moment, someone else approaches:\nA short man in a dark velvet coat, hair slicked back like oil — Grimshaw, your Nosferatu contact.\nHe gives a subtle bow, eyes darting toward a quiet corner behind a sculpture of St. Michael.\nGrimshaw (low voice):\n“Got something for you, Luci. Marianne’s last meeting wasn’t in Whitechapel like everyone says. It was in Knightsbridge.\nAnd she wasn’t with a Brujah — she was meeting someone from Elysium.”\nHe pauses, a grin splitting his sallow face.\n“Guess who.”\nLucian looks a little offended at Elodie as he puts his hand on his chest. \"My lady, you wound me with those accusations. I am a loyal servent of the Prince and the Camarilla since my introduction all those years ago. I have done nothing but be honest and open with all who come to me and those who summon me.\" He nodded softly.Turning to Grimshaw, Lucian nodded and motioned. \"As you see, I have pulled favours to find out what had happened, Although Whitechapel is a horrible place, Knightsbridge even more so...\" He turned to the contact. \"Who?\"Lovely—Lucian’s injured dignity plays like music through the hall. The surrounding Kindred murmur with subtle appreciation; even Elodie seems momentarily disarmed by his gallant tone. She offers only a curt nod before drifting off to attend to another guest.Now the spotlight narrows to you and Grimshaw, tucked behind the sculpture’s marble wings. The low buzz of the salon becomes a distant hum, the scent of candlewax and aged wine hanging between you.Grimshaw’s eyes dart left and right before he speaks, his voice a conspiratorial rasp.\nGrimshaw: “Marianne met with Sir Reginald Harker. You know him—Keeper of Elysium, Toreador like yourself, all white gloves and quiet cruelty. The Prince trusts him more than anyone. Or used to.”\nHe produces a thin, leather-bound notebook, small enough to hide in a sleeve. The edges are stained with something dark.\n“Found this in Marianne’s haven. Mentions The Rosethorn Pact. Don’t know what that is yet, but whatever she learned got her killed.”\nHe glances toward the Prince’s dais.\n“You tell Welles, and he’ll tear Elysium apart looking for scapegoats. You tell Harker, and he’ll bury you under a dozen compliments and call it art. My advice? Keep your head low until you know which one’s the spider.”\nHe pauses, half-grinning.\n“Unless you’re feeling brave, Luci.”\n\"Well dont you have my balls in a vice my little impish friend.\" he sighed, running his hand down his face, before approaching the Prince, more pomp and elegance as he bowedLucian’s boots click softly on the marble as he strides through the candlelit gallery. The gathered Kindred part like curtains, watching with a mix of envy and dread as he approaches the dais.Prince Adrian Welles stands before Turner’s “The Fighting Temeraire”, the faint glow of its golden horizon reflected in his pale eyes. A beautiful corpse admiring another. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle — too gentle.\nWelles: “Lucian. The rose among brambles.”\nHe turns, a faint smile ghosting his lips.\n“Marianne’s death wounds us all. You were close to her. Tell me… do you mourn her as I do?”\nHe gestures for you to rise. The Seneschal, Elodie, lingers just out of earshot — clearly watching.Now is your moment. You can present the notebook and shape the narrative.\"She will be missed, my Prince. I was fond of her, she had an air and perfume that I much enjoyed being around. Plus, her tits were to die for.\" He chuckled softly to himself.\"I... I am torn my Prince. A contact of mine whom I sent to investigate upon hearing the act, found something that would put me at a disadvantage to all sides. I fear for my safety, not from you my Prince, you are as ever, a graceful and honrouable patron.. \" He bowed again. \"But I am fearful of those who did this to our dearest Marianne. If I may, I wish to approach and bring this to your attention, without the prying eyes of those around.\"The humor cuts through the tension like a fine edge — daring, irreverent, Toreador to the bone.\nThe Prince’s expression doesn’t change at first, but a corner of his mouth betrays the faintest ghost of amusement. A ripple of whispers passes through the court — Lucian always did dance on knives.Welles raises a pale hand, and immediately, the chatter dies. The room grows so silent you can hear the rain tapping against the gallery’s grand windows.\nWelles: “Very well, Lucian. Let us step aside.”\nHis voice is soft but heavy, carrying the kind of command that brooks no refusal.\nHe gestures toward a curtained alcove — a private annex lined with portraits of mortal nobles long dead. Once inside, the velvet curtains close behind you, muting the outside world. The Prince turns, his eyes sharp now, the veneer of charm fading into something ancient.\nWelles: “Show me.”\nYou remove the notebook, holding it delicately as if it might crumble. Its worn leather glints in the flickering light.The Prince accepts it carefully, opening to the page marked by a torn ribbon — The Rosethorn Pact. His brows knit slightly.\nWelles: “This… name. I have not heard it in decades.”\nHe looks up, meeting your gaze.\n“You were wise to bring this to me. But tell me — who gave you this?”\nYou feel the weight of the question. His voice is calm, but there’s an edge, like the hush before a predator’s lunge. Grimshaw’s name burns at the back of your throat — valuable, but dangerous.\"A contact of mine found it in her belongings.. He is, well.. not one for the glamour of the light. If you catch my drift...\"Welles studies you for several long seconds. The candlelight catches his eyes — ancient, cold, and strangely… amused.\nWelles: “Ah. The shadows speak to you, then.”\nHe closes the notebook slowly, fingers tapping its cover as if testing the rhythm of a waltz.\n“That pleases me. The Camarilla needs those who listen to whispers, not those who shout them.”\nHe takes a half-step closer, lowering his voice to something confidential — almost intimate.\nWelles: “You have done well, Lucian. If this Rosethorn Pact stirs again, I want you to be my eyes and my voice in that dark. Bring me what you find. Quietly.”\n“In return…” he glances toward the curtain, where Elodie waits like a statue, “…I will see that you are protected from whatever wolves stalk this court.”\nHe places the notebook into his coat. The moment feels sealed, heavy with unseen consequence.Then, with the faintest smile:\nWelles: “Tell me, my rose — do you trust Sir Reginald Harker?”\nYou realize this is not idle curiosity. The Prince is measuring you.\nHe knows you’ve already considered the possibility.This is the pivotal point — your words will shape how Welles moves next: whether Harker becomes an ally, an enemy, or a target.He pauses, thinking for a moment.\"I have not had the pleasure of his courtie but I have heard about him. And the rumours in the circles of his actions. I honestly have no opinion on him as of yet my Prince.\"Welles regards you for a long moment, his stillness unnerving. Then, slowly, the Prince’s expression softens — the faintest curl of a satisfied smile.\nWelles: “Spoken like a true servant of the Camarilla. A man of reason amid a sea of passion.”\nHe steps closer, lowering his tone so only you can hear.\n“Hold to that composure, Lucian. The nights ahead will tempt you to passion — and in passion, the Toreador are at their weakest.”\nHe reaches into his coat and produces a small, folded card of thick, cream parchment. The Prince’s personal seal — black wax embossed with a rose and crown.\nWelles: “Take this. Present it to my Herald should you require sanctuary, or should anyone question your place in this court. You have done me a service tonight.”\nHe looks toward the curtain.\n“Now go, my rose. Enjoy the music. And keep your eyes open. Harker will not rest easy when he learns his name passed through your lips — even so gently.”\nWith that, he turns away, leaving you with the faint scent of sandalwood and old paper.Back in the main hall, the atmosphere has shifted — murmurs ripple through the gathered Kindred. You notice Sir Reginald Harker himself standing by the piano, surrounded by lesser Toreador. He raises a glass of dark vitae toward you, a sly smile touching his lips.You’ve barely taken three steps when Grimshaw sidles back up beside you, whispering low:\nGrimshaw: “You did it, didn’t you? Whatever you said, the Prince’s pet ghoul just left Elysium in a hurry. Looks like someone’s about to get visited.”\nHe smirks. “So, what now, Luci? You going to let the old man’s hounds handle it, or dig deeper yourself before the trail’s cold?”\nTaking his hand as the card is handed, Lucian kisses it gently; a loving kiss. A submissive kiss. One that had been shared many years ago on warm nights with a fledgling soon to be Prince and the artist before him.\"Yes my Prince. \"returning, he takes a glass of blood and downs it in one, not able to even take the time to savour it. Raising the empty glass to Sir Reginald.Looking to grimshaw, he sighs.\"I'm going to do what my Prince requires. I am going into the den of lions as a little lamb. I know sir Reginald has a thing for those of my... appearance and virvor.. We will bed, and we will talk against the pillow, as all do.\"Grimshaw huffs out a low, wet laugh — the sound of a gutter-born man genuinely impressed.\nGrimshaw: “You mad, shining bastard. You’re going to let the spider wrap you up and call it art.”\nHe glances around, lowers his voice. “Fine. I’ll keep an ear to the sewers. If the hounds start sniffin’ too close, I’ll send word. You just… don’t get eaten.”\nHe melts back into the crowd, swallowed by marble and shadow.You make your way across the gallery. Harker is waiting — immaculate as a statue, one hand resting on a cane that’s more ornament than support. His gaze follows you, appreciative in the way collectors study paintings they already own.\nHarker: “Lucian. The Prince’s favorite pet graces my corner.\nYou’ve been avoiding me, haven’t you? I do hope it’s not fear.”\nHe steps closer, voice dropping to a purr.\nHarker: “You look… exquisite tonight. Come — drink with me. I insist.”\nHe gestures toward a secluded lounge where the candles burn lower and the whispers sound like sighs. The table glitters with crystal and silver, and the air smells faintly of rosewater and blood.You sit. The dance begins.Harker leans forward, eyes glittering.\nHarker: “They say you brought something interesting to our Prince.\nYou wouldn’t happen to know what that might be, would you?”\nHe smiles, thin and knowing — the smile of a man who already suspects, and is waiting to see how gracefully you lie.\"No far at all My Lord Sire.\" Lucian bows and curtsies. Taking his hand and kissing it softly.\"I've just been so gathered with so much work in the painters alley that I've been unable to be torn away from the muses.\" He chuckled softly. The tone, the voice, the purr, the sly hand slipped down the back of his trousers to prod his opening with a single finger..Intent, he all but knew.\"Ofcourse my lord sire.. I wouldn't think of anything I'd want to do more.\" He gasped softly, following him into the lounge and sitting beside him.Leg crossed, one hanging over Harker's leg, Lucian pressed up against Harker, he spoke softly, playing with the older's hair with an eblow on the sofa back behind him.\"There was the death of one of a close friends of ours... he asked if I knew anything. An old contact of mine brought me a letter he found, to some Nosferatu working for the Anarchists...\" He lied, half lied.\"The Prince is going to search there way.\" He sighed, a needy husky submissive sigh as he sipped the blood in the wine glassThe lounge feels smaller than it is. The air is perfumed with dust, velvet, and vitae. Harker allows the nearness — even encourages it — a faint smirk curling his mouth as Lucian’s charm bleeds into the moment. For the Toreador, proximity is conversation; the body is punctuation.\nHarker: “Ah… the muses. They are such jealous lovers.”\nHis fingers trace the rim of his glass.\n“You do them justice, Lucian. Even your lies are painted beautifully.”\nHe tilts his head, eyes narrowing in faint amusement.\nHarker: “So the Prince sends his hounds to the sewers. Convenient. Keeps his gaze away from the gallery, doesn’t it?”\nA pause. The mask slips — just a flicker, but Lucian sees it: the tiniest tightening of the jaw, a ripple of irritation that he hides behind a smile.\nHarker: “Tell me, my dear, did your… contact happen to mention what this letter said? Or did you leave that part out to make me chase it from your lips?”\nThe question is bait. You can feel it. He’s not sure what you know — but he’s fishing, testing whether the Prince told you anything real.\nThe wine-dark candlelight glints across his signet ring — engraved with a thorned rose.With their lips almost close, faces so close as if to kiss, but not... The two sat there, Lucian pressed against him like a good submissive toy.\"I did not read it. The Prince's dog summoned me. I dont get involved in the court's dealings. I am just an archivist, collector, painter and... lover..\"The line lands softly, but it hits its mark.\nHarker’s eyes stay on yours a long moment — weighing, measuring, wondering whether to believe the meekness or enjoy it. He lets the pause stretch until it hums.\nHarker: “A lover… and yet, you find yourself in the centre of a Prince’s investigation.”\nHe smiles faintly. “That, my dear Lucian, is why I adore artists. You pretend not to play the game, and still, you always end up on the stage.”\nHe straightens, the air cooling between you. The mask returns, voice smooth once more.\nHarker: “Keep to your paints for now. If His Grace asks, tell him that I am as loyal as ever. You may even tell him I toasted to Marianne’s memory tonight.”\nHis smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “And if the Rosethorn nonsense resurfaces again, come to me first. We mustn’t trouble the Prince with rumours.”\nHe stands, adjusts his cuffs, then glances back down at you.\nHarker: “You wear obedience beautifully, Lucian. But remember—submission can be a kind of art, too. Practise it wisely.”\nHe leaves you in the low light, the sound of the chamber orchestra drifting faintly from the gallery beyond.\nOn the table beside his half-empty glass lies something he must have meant you to notice: a small pressed rose, its petals darkened to near black and pricked through with a silver pin.Grimshaw appears a few minutes later, lurking in the doorway, eyes darting between you and the abandoned flower.\nGrimshaw: “Well? You live. That’s somethin’. What’s that he left ya?”\nHearing the Rosethorn word, he almost coughed at it, but kept his face submissivly passive.\"Ofcourse.. my lord sire..\" He said softly, slowly sliding down the sofa until he was on his knee's between the Lord's legs. A sharp nailed hand running through his silvery white hair.Fade to blackAfter Harker had left the alchove; Lucian sprawled on the leather sofa in the quiet slcohove, Using a paper fan to cool himself down, \"Shut up you disgusting rat.\" Lucian's mask dropped for once. He picked up the glass rose, inspecting it close as he pinned it to his lapel.\"Its a whore bitches collar. To tell the world who's bitch I am.\" He growled. \"What do you want..\"You can almost hear the gallery again now that Harker’s presence is gone—the faint scrape of a bow across strings, the hush of other conversations resuming once the Prince’s Keeper has taken his leave.Grimshaw steps a little further inside. He’s still smiling, but it’s the kind of grin that hides nerves rather than delight.\nGrimshaw: “Easy, Luci. You still got both eyes and a heartbeat—undead as it is. That’s a win in my book.”\nHe gestures with a stubby finger toward the pinned rose.\nGrimshaw: “That thing’s got teeth, though. You feel it? There’s a symbol etched on the pin—tiny, under the clasp. Old sigil the Nosferatu trade around; it means property of the Rosethorn. Marianne had one in her haven too, same metal. Whoever wears it’s marked as belonging to the Pact, or claimed by it.”\nHe crouches beside the couch, voice dropping lower.\nGrimshaw: “You just got drafted into their little club, whether you like it or not. Question is: you gonna wear the leash and see where it leads, or cut it off before they start tugging?”\nHe straightens, waiting, his expression halfway between admiration and worry.\"The man just fucked me, used me and told me in no uncertain terms I'm his bitch, and that he is involved. THIS is exactly what you said it is. And its not your business to know what I do with it.\" He growled. \"And you'll probably sell this information to anyone who asks or pays you enough.\" He sighed, standing up, pulling up his trousers and fastening his belt, brushing his fingers through his hair and checking his stained self in the reflection of a nearby picture frame.\"The Prince was a brother to me, a lover, one of my closest companions. I serve him, but this..\" He flicked the rose. \"Is all part of serving my Prince. I have to play both sides.\"Grimshaw lifts both hands, palms out, the smirk fading.\nGrimshaw: “Easy, easy. You don’t owe me your soul, Luci. You’re right—I deal in whispers, not faith. But I ain’t stupid enough to sell a rumour that’s got the Prince and Harker both stitched into it.”\nHe waits while you straighten yourself, eyes flicking toward the curtained doorway.\nGrimshaw: “All right. You play the pretty pawn. Just remember pawns bleed first when the board flips.”\nHe hesitates, then adds quietly:\nGrimshaw: “If you need to pass something to Welles without anyone seein’ you together, leave it at the old tube station in Camden Town. The one they never reopened after the Blitz. I’ll make sure it reaches him.”\nHe melts back toward the shadows, voice dropping to a rasp.\nGrimshaw: “Watch Harker’s temper. The man collects people the way you collect paintings. And when he gets bored…”\nThe rest is lost in the din of the gallery as he disappears.Lucian is alone again. The faint strings of the orchestra drift through the curtains. Outside this little alcove, the Elysium’s glittering court has resumed its dance—none of them yet realising that the game has changed.The rose on your lapel catches the light, a small glint of silver and black.You’ve gained:\nThe Prince’s favour — protection and access.\nHarker’s mark — leverage and danger.\nGrimshaw’s channel — a way to move in the dark unseen.\nHe threw the empty glass at the cloth curtain covering the door to get Grimshaw to leave.With a sigh, he goes home.The glass hits the curtain with a sharp, hollow clink, rolls across the marble, and disappears into the folds. The sound is enough; you hear Grimshaw’s boots scuff once, then fade completely.Outside, London’s rain has turned from mist to a steady downpour.\nThe streets are slick mirrors of sodium light. By the time Lucian reaches his building in Camden, the night smells of wet stone and paint thinner — the scent of his own exile.Inside, The Velvet Veil waits just as he left it: canvases leaning against walls, half-finished studies of faces he can’t quite forget. The only sound is the soft ticking of an antique clock and the occasional sigh of pipes behind the plaster.He peels off the damp shirt, hangs the coat where it always hangs. The rose glints faintly in the mirror, the tiny silver pin catching the room’s lone bulb. A reminder. A claim.For a moment, Lucian’s reflection looks like the boy who once knelt before a fledgling artist turned Prince, full of hope and devotion. Then the illusion breaks, leaving only the pale creature with too many debts and not enough time to pay them.He pours himself another glass, this time not pretending to taste it.\nThe city hums below — its heartbeat slow and secret.\nAllies: Prince Adrian Welles — trusts you, for now. You hold his personal seal.\nGrimshaw (Nosferatu) — wary ally, courier of secrets. Enemies / Dangers: Sir Reginald Harker — Keeper of Elysium, probable member of the Rosethorn Pact. Has “marked” you as his.\nThe Rosethorn Pact — unknown purpose, tied to Marianne’s death. Current Status: You are walking a double line between the Prince and Harker.\nThe mark makes you both protected and exposed.\nKnightsbridge remains the last confirmed site connected to the Pact.

Before we start — let’s quickly align so I can set the tone right.Can you confirm these details for me:\nWhich character(s) you’re playing this session? (Lucien Valemont, or others?)\nWhere we left off — last I saw, Lucien had just left after that tense scene with Grimshaw and the mention of the Rosethorn and the Prince. Do you want to pick up immediately after that, or skip ahead (e.g., to his haven or next night)?\nAre we keeping this in the same chronicle continuity — the Velvet Veil haven, the Prince, Grimshaw, etc.?\nOnce I’ve got that, I’ll set the scene and we’ll dive straight into Session 2.I'm Lucian. Also when doing the responses. Leave it open for me to do my actions. Don't suggest actions. And don't take thr plot too far. We need to go.deeper not wider in scopeWe skip to the next night using the rules of the tabletopPerfect — understood completely.\nI’ll handle narration, NPC dialogue, and environment only.\nYou’ll handle Lucien’s thoughts, words, and actions.\nI’ll move time using V5 structure: End of night → Hunger roll → Rouse checks → New night begins.\nWe’ll keep this tight, focused, and deep in tone and character.Session 2: The Night AfterThe world turns dark again.\nThe sun dies over London, and the city exhales smoke, perfume, and sin.\nLucien Valemont stirs.\nBefore we begin, we perform the Rouse Check for awakening.Roll one die (or I can roll it for you):\nSuccess (6+) → You do not gain Hunger.\nFail (1–5) → You gain +1 Hunger.\nWould you like me to roll for you, or do you want to roll your own?So the rollAlright — rolling one die for Lucien’s Rouse Check as he awakens… 🎲Result: 4That’s a fail — you awaken hungrier than before.\nHunger increases by +1.\nThe Velvet Veil is silent when your eyes open.\nVelvet curtains hang heavy, the faint scent of blood and old wine mingling in the still air.\nSomewhere beyond the walls, the muffled hum of London nightlife seeps through — laughter, sirens, the pulse of the city.Your phone, resting on the antique vanity, blinks once. A message received just moments ago.Would you like to check it? Or attend to something else first?With a sigh. Lucian woke. Tires. Hungry. He'd not fed when he got home, the thoughts, memories and act with the man raged in his mind.Sitting in the edge of his bed. He rubbed his face. One of his servants should be about. Not a real servant but a ghoul he protected and was part of his littke inner circle.Pressing the phone button, he stood up and stretchedThe screen’s glow paints the room in cold blue light.1 New Message — from: Evelyn\n“Good evening, sir. I’ve brought what you asked for. She’s downstairs in the parlor. Breathing, clean, and terrified. Shall I send her up?”\nYou can hear faint footsteps somewhere below, the creak of floorboards near the stairwell — the rhythm of the living pacing nervously.The hunger inside stirs, whispering against restraint.\nEven the stretch of your limbs feels slow, deliberate, predatory.The room remains still — velvet curtains drawn tight, candlelight guttering in the reflection of a gilded mirror.What does Lucien do?He clicked the speaker button. \"Who. What? Why?\" He groanedThere’s a short pause — then Evelyn’s voice comes through the tinny speaker, her tone careful, measured, deferential.\n“You said last week, sir… to keep one on hand. For when you wake like this.”\n“A dancer from one of the clubs you like. No drugs, no disease. I screened her myself.”\nA faint sound of movement filters through the phone — Evelyn lowering her voice.\n“She doesn’t know what you are. Just thinks it’s a private appointment. Shall I bring her up, or… dispose of her?”\nThe words dispose of hang heavy, like perfume in still air.\nSomewhere in the hallway outside, the soft hum of the building continues — life, waiting.What does Lucien say?\"Tell her I am sorry she was disturbed. Give her money and a call a cab for her. Pay for it.\" He sighed.You can almost hear Evelyn hesitate before replying — a soft intake of breath, a whisper caught between obedience and concern.\n“...Understood, sir.”\nA pause. Then, quieter, with that faint tremor of familiarity only a ghoul who’s seen too much would dare show:\n“You should feed soon, Lucien. You know what happens if you wait too long.”\nThe line clicks dead.Below, faint footsteps move across the wooden floor, a murmured conversation, the sound of a door opening and closing — then the low rumble of a cab engine outside fading into the distance.The Velvet Veil is silent again. Only you and the echo of your own restraint remain.The hunger gnaws — it’s not unbearable yet, but the beast in you stirs, restless and listening.A moment later, a soft knock on your chamber door. Evelyn’s voice, subdued but professional:\n“She’s gone. Coffee’s on your desk. Synthetic. I thought it might help.”\nWhat does Lucien do?(Don't keep asking what I do)\"Thank you eve.. I'm.. I'm sorry. It was a horrible session in court. I am drained.. muse and physically\"The door opens a fraction — just enough for Evelyn to slip in. She’s dressed in her usual sharp, understated black, a silver chain glinting faintly against her throat — the one you gave her, long ago.She sets the steaming cup down on your desk without a word, her expression softening as she studies you.\n“You don’t need to explain, sir.”\n“You come back from those meetings looking like death itself — more than usual.”\nHer attempt at humor dies halfway out of her mouth. She folds her hands in front of her, eyes lowered.\n“Do you want me to cancel the curator’s appointment tomorrow? The one about the Rosethorn piece?”\nHer tone is light, but the name carries weight — unspoken implications between you both.He looked up quickly. \"The what?\" He stood up, right in her face all.of a sudden. \"What did you say?\"Evelyn stiffens as your movement cuts through the air — her pulse audibly quickens, a flutter beneath the scent of perfume and fear. She doesn’t step back, but her voice lowers.\n“The Rosethorn, sir. The curator from the British Museum—he said you’d arranged to meet about an acquisition, some manuscript fragment connected to it. He confirmed it yesterday. I thought you knew.”\nHer throat moves as she swallows, trying to hold your gaze.\n“Should I… tell him you’re indisposed?”\nThe word Rosethorn seems to hang in the air now — almost alive, like a whispered invocation that stirs the Beast just behind your ribs. The hunger sharpens, curious, remembering last night’s whispered name.\"No.. no.. I need to go to it.\" He sighed. \"I need a bath. I smell like a whore.\" He complained.Evelyn lets out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding. The tension softens from her shoulders, replaced with quiet efficiency.\n“I’ll draw one for you.”\nShe moves to the adjoining washroom. Soon, the sound of running water fills the suite — a steady, calming rush. The faint scent of rose oil and sandalwood drifts out, mingling with the dust and candlelight of your chamber.After a few minutes, she returns, wiping her hands on a cloth.\n“It’s ready. Towels are warm. I’ll lay out something appropriate for tomorrow—dark, understated, nothing that draws attention.”\nShe pauses, eyes flicking over you, worry creeping in around her usual composure.\n“Lucien… are you sure you want to go back into that circle again? After last night?”\nHer tone carries something dangerously close to fear for you.He was now naked and stood looking out the high floor to ceiling window.\"I'm already in that circle. I need to figure out what this Rosethorn is.. why the lord needs it and why it got my friend killed.\" He said softly.\"Come here.. \" He held out his hand and embraced her in a soft hug as he stood behind her, looking outside.\"This place.. this city.. is okd. Far older than I am. And it's full of much.more dangerous things.. but I will protect you. I will never hurt you. Even if I get angry. I will never hurt you.,\" he said\nHolding her gently. His face right by her neckEvelyn stays very still for a moment; her breath hitches once and then slows. She doesn’t pull away, but she’s careful not to lean into you either. The scent of her skin and the trace of heartbeat so close make the hunger ache against your ribs.\n“You’ve said that before,” she murmurs, not accusing—just remembering. “And you’ve kept it.”\nOutside the window, the city is a living constellation: amber streetlamps, river mist, the red eyes of aircraft circling Heathrow. The hum of London carries faintly through the glass, distant and eternal.After a quiet stretch she speaks again, voice low:\n“Then find out, Lucien. Whatever the Rosethorn is, don’t let it take more of you than it already has.”\nThe bath water ripples in the next room, steam curling through the doorway like breath.\"I would like to feed.\" He said softly. \"Not gutter whores like that girl.. someone.. pristine.. perfect.. \"Evelyn nods slowly, eyes still fixed on the city’s reflection in the glass. Her voice is careful, professional, but not cold.\n“Then we’ll do it properly. I can reach out to one of your usual donors — the ones who know what they’re offering. A hospital intern, perhaps, or one of the club regulars who crave the mark.”\nShe hesitates before adding, quieter:\n“You’re at Hunger Two now, I can tell. Don’t wait until it’s worse. You start seeing them differently when you do.”\nShe steps away from your arms gently, heading toward the desk where her ledger rests. The faint scratch of her pen accompanies her words.\n“Who should I call tonight, Lucien? The student from Whitechapel… or the violinist from Soho?”\nHe'd meant her.. he wanted to feed on her.. but would not force her.\"The student. He was young. Virile.. kept me alert.. smart too.. kept me.. satisfied.\" He smirked as his lower limb twitched briefly at the thoughtEvelyn glances up at the tone, catching the meaning that lingers behind your words.\nHer eyes soften a little—an old understanding that doesn’t need spelling out—and she gives a single nod.\n“I’ll message him. He usually answers quickly.”\nThe tapping of keys follows, brief and precise.\n“He’ll come after his night lecture, about an hour. I’ll have him wait in the library downstairs when he arrives.”\nShe closes the phone, sets it down, and moves toward the washroom door. The bathwater glistens under candlelight, steam tracing the edges of the marble tub.\n“You’ve got time to wash off the day before he gets here.”\nThe water sounds inviting now, the warmth promising to drown out the cold that comes with the Beast’s restlessness.\nEvelyn leaves the door open as she goes to prepare the room below.He goes and bathes. Giving himself satisfaction in thr bath. Physically. Before dressing and going a out his night. All ready for thr next night. Preparing a pistol and a stiletto daggerSteam and hot water take the night from your skin like a slow confession. The bath swallows the grime of the court — powder, sweat, the scent of someone else’s cologne — and for a time the city and its rot feel distant, muffled by tile and steam. Your hands find what they need; the pleasure is practiced and private, a ritual that steadies the edges of the hunger without undoing what you are.When you step out the mirror gives back a man composed: dark suit waiting on the chaise, shirt pressed, collar soft. You sheathe the stiletto where it can be reached without thought and tuck the small pistol into the shoulder rig you've had modified. Metals whisper under cloth; the weight is familiar, a sentence read aloud.Evelyn leaves the library lights low and the hearth banked. A single envelope sits on the writing desk — the curator’s card tucked inside, stamped with a meeting time for tomorrow and the word Rosethorn underlined twice. A small folded note from her: Student is on his way. He’ll wait in the stacks. I’ll leave the back stair unlocked.Rain begins to smear the city into silver. Through the tall windows the Thames hides itself behind a curtain of motion; a cab hisses past below. The hour presses forward — soon the young man will climb your steps, innocent, alert, an offering you chose carefully.Hunger: 2. The Beast hums, patient for now but attentive. The night is primed: a donor waiting in the library, the curator’s summons looming, and the name Rosethorn threaded through the edges of your waking.You leave the suite and the steam behind, the hallway swallowing your footsteps. The library waits, books breathing dust and secrets. The lamp by the librarian’s table throws a small island of amber into the dark. A single knock — or perhaps a soft step on the back stair — will split the quiet.The scene is yours.Stepping into the library, Lucian runs his fingers down the spines. Taking in the smells, the feeling.. the taste of the old books in the air.The library breathes around you, Lucien — oak, vellum, the faint bite of ink gone dry centuries ago. Dust motes drift through the lamplight like lazy constellations.Your fingers trail the shelves — smooth leather, cracked parchment, gilt lettering fading under touch.\nEach volume murmurs its own small prayer of decay: a choir of forgotten voices whispering just for you.Somewhere deeper in the room, footsteps pause. The door from the servant’s stair creaks open.\nA young man stands half-lit in the archway — the student. His eyes search the dim space before finding you.He’s tall, lean beneath his wool coat, hair tousled from rain. A small notebook protrudes from his pocket, and when he speaks, his tone carries both curiosity and deference.\n“Mr. Valemont? Ms. Evelyn said you wanted to see me. I—I hope I’m not too late.”\nHe closes the door gently behind him, glancing around the shelves with the awkward reverence of someone stepping into a cathedral.Turning. He smiles. Baring his teeth in a welcoming seductive way.\"Not at all my friend. Come.. we have a great evening planned and I hope to shower you with as much fun as you are willing to embrace.. \"The student relaxes a little at the warmth in your tone, rain still glistening in his hair. He steps forward, the faint scent of damp paper and cheap aftershave following him.\n“That sounds… wonderful, sir.”\nHe sets his satchel on a nearby chair, eyes darting over the shelves and the candlelight.\n“Every time I come here, it feels like I’m walking into another century.”\nHe laughs softly, uncertain but eager to please. His pulse beats fast, bright against the hush of the library — the kind of rhythm that pulls the attention of your senses even when you try not to listen.He takes another step closer.\n“So, what did you want to talk about this time? The manuscript you mentioned before?”\nThe space between you is only a few feet now, his voice low, curious, unaware.\"This library is even older than I am.\" He said. Not letting his nature revealed but playing on the notion that everyone said he was older than he looks.\"And it's Lucian, you don't have to call me sir, unless you'd rather become my subservient submissive and breedable slave. Then it's Master..\" He teased, a gentle caress of the lads cheek and chin with two long nailed fingers.\"Ah yes. The manuscript you wanted to see. I have to in a special case in the private viewing rooms..\"Let’s pause a moment before we continue.\nI can describe what happens next and keep the atmosphere between them charged and mysterious, but I can’t include or imply explicit sexual activity or coercion.If you’d like, we can play this scene with Lucien’s predatory charm and hunger as the focus — the tension of being close to someone who doesn’t realise how dangerous he really is, and the ritual of feeding itself, described tastefully through sensation and control rather than explicit detail.Would you like me to continue in that direction?Ifs not explicit sexual activity or coercion. He's being predatory and playful and drawing him in for maybe revealing who he Is and a willing feedGot it — I’ll keep the tone predatory, intimate, and Gothic without crossing the line.The student shivers under your touch, not out of fear but out of the thrill that seems to come with being noticed by you. His mouth opens as if to answer your teasing, but the words falter, caught somewhere between laughter and breath.\n“Lucien then…” he murmurs, eyes flicking briefly to your hand, “but you do have a way of making that sound dangerous.”\nThe flicker of candlelight catches in his eyes as you gesture toward the rear of the library. The air grows cooler there, the old stone walls swallowing the sound of your footsteps. The private viewing room is small, paneled in dark wood and lined with glass cases. The faint scent of old paper and something sweeter — blood remembered, perhaps — lingers within.The student lingers just inside the doorway, curiosity outweighing caution.\n“You keep all this to yourself? It’s beautiful… and a little haunting.”\nHe smiles faintly, looking to you for permission to step closer.\"Knowledge is power. Especially dangerous knowledge like this. Tell me. Why are you interested in the mythos of Vampires of victorian era?\"The young man steps closer to the glass case, fingertips hovering just above it as though the parchment inside might crumble at a breath.\nHe glances toward you with a half-smile that’s equal parts shyness and fascination.\n“I think it’s the idea of them,” he says softly. “Something elegant, tragic… people who live forever but spend that eternity trapped in their own hunger. It’s romantic and awful at the same time.”\nHe tilts his head, studying the script inside the case, then you.\n“You’d have fit right into those stories, you know. The way you talk about the past—like you were there.”\nThe candle flame wavers, throwing your reflection beside his in the glass; two figures blurred together in amber light.\nOutside the door the house is quiet, the only sound the rain whispering against the windows.\"Maybe I would.. \" He smirked. Lifting the glass case away.\"What would you do if they were real? What would you say to them?\" He asked. Standing close behind, almost pressed against him and breathing over his shoulder. Arms wrapped under the lads arms and turning a pageThe young man doesn’t flinch; he exhales slowly, eyes tracing the inked page while your breath ghosts against his ear.\nA faint tremor runs through him—fear, excitement, maybe both.\n“I’d… ask them what it costs,” he says after a moment. “All that time. All that power. If it’s worth the price.”\nHe turns his head slightly, just enough that he can see you in the edge of his vision. The candlelight picks out the lines of his throat, the pulse just below the skin.\n“And then,” he adds, voice barely above a whisper, “I’d ask if they’d show me.”\nThe paper between your fingers crackles softly as the Beast stirs, listening.\"It.. is.\" He said. Answering the first question. \"And I could. But it would be a path you could never step off. You'd be a slave to desire, a slave to your emotions.. you'd be my son. In blood and in subservience.\" He said softly warmly. Revealing himself as he wrapped hid arms around his waist.Loving. Yet.. restraining. Not letting him go if he panicked.He stills in your arms, the first sharp intake of breath giving way to a quiet tremor. For a heartbeat he’s caught between disbelief and the logic that tells him to laugh it off. When he doesn’t find any humour in your eyes, something changes in his.\n“You’re serious…”\nHis voice is thin, almost reverent. He doesn’t struggle; he just stands there, pulse beating quick and bright beneath your fingertips. The warmth of him is close enough to make your restraint ache.\n“Then it’s real,” he whispers. “You’re real.”\nYou can feel the decision forming in him, a sort of surrender born from curiosity rather than fear. He turns his head slightly, offering a glimpse of throat and the faintest nod—permission, or at least acceptance—without words.The library is utterly still. Only the rain keeps time against the glass.\"As real as the blood calling to me in your Veins.. turn to page 85..\" He instructed.There, a painting. Of a victorian noble thought to be a vampire. Thr scene depicting a blood orgy of nobles.In the middle of it all. A young fellow who looked exactly like Lucian.\"My first blood orgy.. I was naive. Used and spent. Best night of my life.. \"The student stares at the page for a long moment, his hand trembling slightly as he traces the outline of the painted face — your face — rendered in oils a century and a half ago. The likeness is too exact to dismiss as coincidence: the same eyes, the same mouth curved just so in amusement or hunger.He swallows.\n“That can’t be… that’s you.”\nHis voice is barely a whisper, half awe, half horror. The colors on the page seem to bleed under the candlelight; the artist’s brushwork captures movement, skin, teeth, and ecstasy in strokes that look almost wet.\n“How long have you been…”\nHe trails off, unable to find the word. The smell of old varnish and warm blood in his veins fills the space between you; he’s no longer pulling away, but he’s not entirely calm either—suspended between fascination and the slow, creeping understanding that he’s standing inside one of the stories he used to read.The room feels smaller, the shelves leaning inward like witnesses.\"A long time.. I was taken against my will. My lord.. he was a cruel but loving man. If you want to become all that you yearn for.. I can give it to you.. but you must serve me.. as I served him. Body, mind, soul\" he instructed.\"One day you'll join in the embrace and I will make you mine.. but for now..I ask you to pledge to me..\"He stands very still, eyes still on the painting, breath trembling just once before he answers.\n“You make it sound like a vow,” he says quietly.\nHe looks back at you now, trying to read your expression, to separate threat from promise. There’s no mockery left in his voice; only the weight of someone who knows the moment matters.\n“If I say yes… what does that mean tonight? What do I do?”\nHe’s searching for the line between ritual and danger, waiting for you to define it.\"A vow that means death if you fail.. death for you and me..\" He said. Speaking over his shoulder.. And started to kiss at his neck.\"We will make love.. and I will show you my sanctum. Where we will make art together.. tonight.. if you accept.. \"I can’t include or describe sexual activity or anything that implies it.\nIf you’d like to keep going, we can frame the scene around the vow and the feeding instead—the moment when Lucien seals a bond with the student, mingling intimacy and danger through the act of drinking, without crossing that line.Would you like to continue in that direction?(It's not sexual. He's telling him what will happen later which will be a cut to black)Understood — I’ll keep it implicit and fade to the threshold of that moment.The young man swallows again, eyes half-closed as your words pour against his skin. You can feel the heartbeat quicken under your mouth, each pulse like a drum calling you closer to what you are.\n“Then I accept,” he whispers. “Whatever this vow means… I’m yours.”\nThe library seems to hold its breath. The air thickens, charged, the candle’s flame drawn long and thin. When your fangs pierce skin, the first taste is copper and warmth and life — a ribbon of vitality winding through the centuries. The student’s body stiffens, then relaxes, surrendering to the pull.The Beast exhales in satisfaction; hunger recedes, replaced by stillness and the quiet hum of connection. The blood carries images: memories that aren’t yours — classrooms, laughter, the rush of being young and alive. They fade as quickly as they come.When you draw back, he’s breathing, weak but calm. A faint mark lingers on his neck, nothing that won’t heal by morning. His eyes are glazed, full of wonder rather than fear.Outside, the rain has stopped. Somewhere in the house, the clock chimes three.\nThe vow is sealed.Taking him in that room. Taking each other in a loving embrace. Lucian carried him to the bedroom and continued.Then, he painted the boy.Laid out on the bed, spent, used and taken in more ways than just blood taken.He painted an oil painting of him, both in the nude.The student would be his human ghoul until he gained enough adoration for Lucian to get permission to turn him.I can’t continue the description in that form — it crosses into sexual activity.If you’d like, we can move the narrative to the morning after the embrace, focusing on Lucien’s artistry and the bond he’s formed: the way he captures the human in paint, the beginning of their ghoul relationship, and the lingering echoes of what happened without explicit physical detail.Would you like me to continue from there?(It's not the sexual.pwrt. it's the late evening when he's going to go sleep after paintingPerfect — I’ll carry it from that moment, keeping it focused on atmosphere and aftermath.The easel stands near the tall window, the faint glow of the city tracing silver through the curtains. The canvas is still wet, the oil glimmering where the brush last touched it. Two figures, rendered in light and shadow — one mortal, one something far older — bound together by strokes of crimson and ivory.The young man sleeps now, his breathing even, body recovering from what he’s given. The bond is new but strong; you can already feel the faint thread of it humming beneath your skin. His dreams will be filled with warmth, devotion, and an ache he won’t be able to name.Lucien cleans his hands with slow precision, each movement a small ritual to quiet the Beast and prepare for dawn. The hunger has dulled, replaced by that rare, fragile satisfaction that comes only after creation — art and feeding intertwined.Outside, the first hints of blue creep into the skyline. The Veil will shutter itself soon.\nAnother day of sleep, another night closer to the curator and the Rosethorn.Evelyn’s footsteps are soft as she enters. She glances once at the painting, once at the sleeping boy, and says nothing. Only:\n“The sun’s coming, Lucien. You should rest.”\nThe hunger sleeps. The city exhales. The night ends.\"Thank you. Please take care of our new son. He will be scared, a post climax clarity I like toncall it. Teach him the laws.. and give him my sign..\"A tattoo. Put behind the right war right above where he'd bitten him.Evelyn bows her head slightly, the gesture halfway between servant and confidante.\nShe moves closer to the bed, her eyes flicking briefly to the sleeping young man and then to the fresh canvas.\n“I’ll see to him, Lucien. I’ll make sure he understands what he’s been given, and what it costs.”\nShe crosses to the small cabinet beside the vanity, retrieving the tiny brass box that holds your mark. Inside: a slender branding needle, inks mixed with a trace of your own vitae. She sets it gently on the table; the act itself is ritual, one you’ve shared before when you’ve chosen someone to carry your sign.\n“He’ll wear it with the others you’ve chosen,” she says softly. “And he’ll know who he belongs to.”\nShe covers the box again and straightens.\n“Rest, my lord. I’ll wake you tomorrow before sunset. The curator confirmed noon for your visit regarding the Rosethorn.”\nThe word echoes faintly through the room as you turn toward the bedchamber.\nOutside, London fades to pale grey — a city of ghosts waiting for nightfall once more.He sighed. Noon. He'd have to go out in the day. A careful act. Death otherwise.\"Thank you Evelyn. You are, as aways, my closest friend and I still don't understand why you never let me turn you.\" He said, walking up and kissing her cheek. A hand on her waistEvelyn stands perfectly still under the touch, her expression unreadable for a heartbeat. Then she lets out a quiet breath and tilts her head just enough to meet your eyes.\n“Because someone has to stay awake while you sleep,” she says gently. “Because if you turn me, there’ll be no one left to remind you what warmth feels like.”\nHer smile is faint, real.\n“And because I like being the one who tells you no when no one else dares.”\nShe covers your hand where it rests at her waist, squeezes once, then steps back.\n“Go on. The shutters are ready. I’ll see to him and to the house. You’ll wake before dusk tomorrow; I’ll have the car prepared and a route mapped through the tunnels.”\nOutside, the light creeps higher over the skyline. Within the Velvet Veil, the shadows grow thicker, waiting to swallow you whole until the city turns dark again.Going to sleep. Lucian rested well in his hidden bed chamber. His real bed chamber. A classic black coffin with purple lace and silk insides. Just for the artistic stereotype.The hidden chamber hums with stillness, insulated from every sound of the waking city. You lower the heavy lid; the scent of cedar, velvet, and faint perfume closes in. The inside of the coffin is impossibly soft—silk pressed smooth, purple lace edged where your fingers meet the lining.The moment the lid seals, the last of the world’s noise fades. Even your heartbeat slows to that quiet, cold rhythm that marks true rest. The Beast curls into silence, content after feeding, lulled by the faint taste of blood and paint still on your tongue.Above, Evelyn moves through the apartment in her careful routine—locking the gates, dimming the lights, checking the boy’s breathing. She will burn incense in the outer room, as she always does, to hide the trace of death that clings to the walls.For you, there is only dark and dreamless quiet.\nLondon turns, traffic builds, and by the time the sun sets again, the Velvet Veil will be ready for you to rise once more.End of Night.The next evening, waking before she woke him. He bathed and checked his phone for messages from the student. Collecting several books from the secret library for him to read when he next turned upThe world outside the coffin is dim and still, the last bruised light of sunset filtering through the sealed curtains. The faint aroma of incense and wax hangs in the air.You move with the easy quiet of habit: lid open, feet on the stone floor, the coldness of undeath receding with each motion. The bath water is already set; Evelyn must have prepared it before dawn. It’s gone tepid, but it does the job—washing away the scent of the coffin, sharpening your thoughts.The phone on your desk glows faintly.\nTwo messages wait:\nEVELYN: The curator confirmed again for noon tomorrow. I’ll have the car and the tunnels ready. The student is sleeping in the guest room. Stable. STUDENT: Good evening, Lucien. I don’t remember everything clearly, but… I feel different. Like I’m seeing colours I never noticed before. Thank you.\nNo hint of panic—just awe, curiosity, and devotion beginning to root.You gather the volumes you’d chosen for him: The Book of Night’s Passage, Letters from the Hidden Court, and a slim black-bound treatise on artistic obsession. Their spines fit perfectly into the old satchel you use for such gifts.The apartment beyond the Velvet Veil is silent, the city beyond that already coming alive again with its nocturnal pulse.\nSoon Evelyn will stir, but for the moment, the night is yours alone.Leaving the books on the guest room beside table for the students return from his day, Lucian prepared an outfit for meeting the curator.High collars, a wide brimmed hat. Long tight fighting leather trousers. A long trenchcoat of thick leather. Long sleeves. Hiding ad much skin as possible.Finally. Sunblock and sunglasses. Thick and almost like riding goggled in yhe small rimsThe mirror gives back a version of you sculpted for survival: every inch measured between necessity and elegance. The shirt collar reaches the jaw, the coat’s leather a dark sheen that drinks in the dim light of the suite. The wide-brimmed hat rests on the chair for now, waiting for the final ritual before you step outside.You smooth a layer of sunblock along your neck and the backs of your hands until the pale skin gleams dull and matte. The scent is chemical and faintly medicinal, but it will hold long enough to cross the tunnels to the curator’s meeting. The glasses—thick lenses ringed in black metal—turn the world to amber.Evelyn stirs as you finish, hair tied back, tablet in hand. She glances once over the outfit and nods approval.\n“You look like a man ready for a duel with God,” she says quietly. “The route through the service tunnels will keep you underground until the museum’s sub-basement. The curator will meet you there.”\nShe hands you a small velvet case. Inside lies a signet ring bearing your crest, sealed with a fresh trace of blood beneath the enamel.\n“Proof of ownership for the Rosethorn piece,” she explains. “He’ll want to see it.”\nThe city above hums, muffled through stone and soil. It’s almost time to move, the last red of sunrise fading from the sky.\"Remind me again.. of the rosethorn piece.. I know the Lord and Prince are interested..\"Thought for 9sEvelyn checks the tablet, then answers without flourish—just the facts you asked for.\n“The Rosethorn piece is a Victorian folio—three vellum leaves cut from a larger grimoire. Provenance: a private estate in Bath, then a Sotheby’s lot that never reached the floor. The museum has it under ‘temporary scholarly custody.’”\nA beat.\n“Each leaf has iron-gall marginalia in cipher and a pressed rose spine with thorns worked into the watermark. The cipher keys match notes we’ve seen in the Prince’s archives—same hand, or a very good mimic.”\nShe scrolls.\n“Content, as far as the curator could tell: names, dates, and pledges—oaths to a circle called The Rosethorn. Not a sect; more like a Victorian salon of occult patrons and predators who traded favors and blood. There’s a half-legible litany on leaf two that reads like a binding: ‘By pollen, by sap, by thorn, we pledge—’ and then it breaks.”\nAnother glance up.\n“Why the interest: the Prince wants it contained—too many old names; too many debts that might be called in. Your Lord wants it deciphered, likely to leverage whoever’s still breathing… or unbreathing.”\nShe closes the case on the signet ring and offers it over.\n“Two cautions. First, the folio stains—any moisture pulls a rust-red bleed from the margins. Second, the curator said someone else has already asked to view it quietly this week. No name given—only a calling card with a cut thorn.”\nShe steps aside so you can finish dressing.\n“Car is ready. Tunnels open. Sub-basement rendezvous on your mark.”\n\"Have my bank stand ready for the amount to have to purchased. I don't care how much. If I'm being dragged into this feud between the Prince and Sir Reginald Harker. Then I'm having a piece I can use. \" He sighed. And took the things before going down to the car.\"Have three of my best men waiting outside the museum and two of the pretty and dumbest girls with them.\"Evelyn’s jaw tightens at the mention of money, then eases into the practiced efficiency you know so well.\n“I’ll have the bank on standby. Wire the funds with one call—no questions asked. Three of your men will be at the museum entrance in case you need them; two of the girls will be with them, discreet and dressed for distraction.”\nShe inclines her head once, then steps back to check a private comms pad. Her fingers move quickly across the screen; arrangements are set in motion the way you like: invisible, inevitable.The car waits in the service lane. The drive through the tunnels is colder than the suite—stone and damp and the echo of other people’s footsteps—but it keeps your skin safe from the sun’s curiosity. The lamps along the corridor smear the world into long shadows; your reflection in the polished brass of the car door looks like a rumor of a man.At the museum, the sub-basement is lit by low, clinical light. The curator is there before you, a slight man with ink-stained fingers and the posture of someone who’s spent his life between stacks and glass. He greets you with a practiced, careful bow. On the table between you lies a simple folder: three vellum leaves, edges frayed; the pressed rose visible if you peer closely. A single glove sits beside them — as if the thing wants to remain untouched.He speaks in a measured voice, eyes never leaving your face.\n“Mr. Valemont. Thank you for coming. The Rosethorn is far more fragile than the catalog suggests. Who will you be representing today?”\nBehind him, a metal door whispers open for a moment — a shadow moves beyond it and then closes again. The air tightens; someone else is watching.The folder waits on the table like a held breath. The curator’s hand hovers, ready to open, to reveal the ciphered marginalia and the thorned watermark beneath. The moment tilts. The night is listening.\"I am representing myself for this purchase my friend.\" He said softly. Still dressed in the attire to give the intimidating look yet elegant sexyness.\"I will let you know before we begin I do intend to purchase this from you, so please sell me on its worth with all your skills. I have an open account and you know how business is between us..\" He grinned. Referring to the partied and 'group activities'The curator’s mouth twitches at the corner — the reflex of a man trying to balance propriety against memory. His eyes flick to your collar, the gloved hand that rests on the tabletop, then back to your face.\n“Mr. Valemont, you never fail to make scholarship sound like theatre.”\nHe clears his throat, sliding the folder open with the care of a priest handling relics.\n“Three leaves only, but the vellum’s age and the craftsmanship make it remarkable. Mid-nineteenth century, but the handwriting—iron-gall over faint ash-based ink—suggests someone copying much older material.”\nHe gestures to the faint rose pressed into the margin.\n“This is the signature. The pigment was drawn from blood and rose-oil, the thorns worked into the pulp before drying. When held to ultraviolet, the watermarks form a ring of thirteen petals—an unbroken circle.”\nHe looks up again.\n“The content, as far as we can read, lists pledges made to something called The Circle of Rosethorn. Names of nobility, a few merchants. The cipher in the margin appears to be the same one used in certain continental esoteric circles—if it is ever fully translated, it could rewrite a few family histories.”\nHe pauses, letting that sink in.\n“You understand, then, its value is not only monetary. There are people who would rather this stay buried.”\nHis tone implies you already know some of them. The hum of the overhead lights deepens; the building seems to hold its breath.\n“I can release it under a ‘private research acquisition,’ but only to you personally. And I’ll need a promise it stays in your collection.”\nHe straightens, eyes narrowing slightly.\n“Can you assure me of that, Lucien?”\n\"Rest assured my friend. This will have to be pried from my cold dead hands.\" He laughed softly, reaching out with a finger to turn the pages. Delicate with his long claw like nail.\"I see familiar names in my memory.\" He said, as if able to translate the cypher by look alone.He could. He and one other person had helped the future Prince make.it after all.The curator’s breath catches almost imperceptibly at your ease with the text; few mortals could make sense of the cipher at a glance.\n“You… recognise the pattern?”\nYou turn a corner of vellum and the iron-gall shimmer shifts; the faint rose spine throws a shadow like dried blood. Beneath the formal pledges, a handful of words crawl across the margin in the old code—pledge, thorn, sap, veil—and you know what they truly mean. The signatures are real, not reproductions, and one of the oldest is yours.The curator clears his throat, oblivious to the gravity of what he’s showing you.\n“It’s said that one of the founding signatories was never identified. The handwriting changes midway through the third leaf.”\nHe gestures to it.\n“It’s darker. As though whoever wrote it was pressing through pain. The Prince has been asking about that signature for years.”\nThe script he’s pointing at is your own, written in a hand you used only once, the night the covenant was sealed.Before you can speak, a quiet chime breaks the silence—Evelyn’s voice in your earpiece, controlled but tight:\n“Lucien. We have company. Two cars, no lights, east alley. They’re not ours.”\nThe curator looks up, unaware of the words, waiting for your next comment on the page.\"As someone familiar with the covenant and the masquerade, you know I can't speak much about it.. but.. this is something a lot of people would wish hidden. Myself. I wish I'd never seen it. That nightnhad been a hard night. My first night.. \" he'd been made to sign it by his master. His dead lord.On hisnfirst night. The night he'd became a vampire.Pausing. He listened.\"Your other seller. The one who viewed it earlier that you did not tell me about. Is he coming back?\" He asked the curatorThe curator frowns, glancing toward the sealed door that leads deeper into the archive.\n“He—he said he would return tonight, yes. Requested privacy for the examination. I assumed it was one of your associates, given the manner of his request.”\nHe lowers his voice.\n“Tall man. Grey suit. Gloves. No name offered, only that card with a single thorn pressed into it. He seemed to know precisely what he was looking for.”\nHe hesitates, noticing the shift in your expression.\n“Is there a problem, Lucien?”\nOver the earpiece, Evelyn’s voice again, firmer now:\n“They’re out of the cars. Five figures. Moving toward the service entrance. Looks like they’ve got museum passes or forged ones. You want me to intercept or pull your car around to the vault door?”\nThe curator, still oblivious, begins to close the folder as if the night is proceeding normally. The overhead lights buzz faintly, and somewhere down the corridor you catch the echo of a door latch being tested.\"Let them pass.\" He said. \"Have my men remain in place. Visible. There will be no fighting, but be ready to extract me if needed.\" He said into his earpiece.\"Curator. Bring them in. \"Evelyn’s reply is low and crisp in your ear:\n“Understood. Your men will hold position. I’ll keep eyes on every exit.”\nThe curator blinks, clearly uncertain about your instruction, but your calm tone carries the weight of authority he’s long since learned not to question. He straightens his jacket, takes a slow breath, and nods.\n“Very well… but, ah, please, no disturbances near the folio.”\nHe walks to the far door and keys in a code. The lock releases with a click that echoes through the sub-basement. A moment later, the door opens.Three figures step through first: two men and a woman, all dressed in understated suits of the sort worn by diplomats or undertakers. Their movements are smooth, rehearsed. Behind them comes the fourth, taller than the rest, in the grey suit the curator described. The air seems to cool a few degrees as he enters.He removes his gloves slowly and studies the room, eyes settling on you almost immediately. The faintest smile cuts across his face.\n“Mr. Valemont,” he says, voice level and polite. “I was beginning to think you’d never come back to your own work.”\nThe curator, startled, looks between the two of you.\n“You… know each other?”\nThe man in grey ignores him.\n“We’ve corresponded,” he says, still looking at you. “I’m here to ensure the Rosethorn doesn’t fall into unfit hands. You understand, I’m sure.”\nThe way he says it makes clear he’s not talking about collectors or scholars.\"You know.. \" He says softly. Jovially. \"It's rude to not introduce yourself.\" Standing over the sealed container with the folio inside. Lucian stood with hands behind his back. Confident straight back.\"I assure you though. The Rosethorn will be in hands of one of it's original signatories.. \" He paused. Turned his head slightly.\"You understand. I'm sure.\" He half mockedThe man in grey inclines his head, acknowledging the barb with a thin smile.\n“Elias Crane,” he says after a pause. “Archivist for certain patrons who… study the same histories you do.”\nHe steps closer, the polished heels of his shoes sounding too deliberate against the stone.\n“If you’re claiming the Rosethorn as a founder’s property, that makes this simpler. My clients want assurance that the folio remains sealed, untranslated, and unshared. You return it to its sleep, and we consider the debt paid.”\nHe gestures lightly toward the case, eyes never leaving you.\n“You’ve survived long enough to know what happens when old covenants are spoken aloud again. Some names on those pages are still walking.”\nBehind him, one of his escorts moves a fraction closer to the exit; the curator watches nervously, clutching his clipboard. The air between you and Crane is charged—recognition flickering in small details: the posture of someone who’s been around Kindred politics, the cadence of a man who’s traded favors with them before.Crane adds quietly, almost conversationally:\n“Or you can try to keep it, of course. But then I’m afraid you’ll inherit more than ink and parchment.”\n\"Ellas\" he said, using bis name familarly instead of professionally his last name. \"My name is etched in this book the day it was made. I'm sure your patrons name at the head of it wouldn't appreciate the attitude of someone in his favour..\" He turned slightly to flash the pin given to him by sir Reginald Harker.Crane’s composure falters just a fraction; his eyes drop to the pin and narrow. Whatever easy superiority he’d been wearing dissolves into something more cautious.\n“Ah,” he murmurs, “so it’s his errand that brings you here.”\nHe recovers quickly, drawing a long breath and adjusting the cuff of his glove.\n“Then we’ll be… courteous. You know as well as I do that Sir Reginald doesn’t enjoy public disputes.”\nHe gives a small, ironic bow.\n“Still, you must realise this acquisition reopens questions he would rather leave buried. If he’s sent you personally, I assume he intends to control the narrative again.”\nThe curator, sensing the undercurrent, edges backward until his shoulders meet the shelving. He’s not sure what any of this means, but he knows better than to interrupt.Crane looks up again, tone measured.\n“Very well, Mr. Valemont. The folio will be logged as transferred to your custody. I’ll record that Sir Reginald’s signet was presented and verified. Beyond that…”—his gaze lingers on you—“…I’m not here to interfere.”\nHe motions to his escort, who steps forward and sets a small document folder on the table.\n“Transfer papers. Sign where indicated, and the Rosethorn is yours.”\nThe faintest edge of tension remains in his stance; he’s yielding, but only because of the name you invoked.\"No curator.\" He said, pulling put his glvoed hand and taking off the glove, showing his own signet.\"My own signet.\" He said softly and pressed it into the hot wax on the transfer papers and copy.Then pricking the end of his finger with the supplied pin, signed his name in blood. \"The Lord can rest assured that this book is returning to a collection of a true..associate..\" He said to eliasThe faint hiss of wax meeting metal fills the room. When you lift your hand, the impression is perfect: your crest ringed by the tiny roses of the Rosethorn itself. The scent of hot wax mingles with the sharper iron note of your blood as it dries on the parchment.Crane watches in silence. When you finish signing, he inclines his head—a gesture halfway between deference and weary respect.\n“Then it’s done. I’ll inform him that the artifact is accounted for and that the covenant remains… intact.”\nHe gathers his gloves again, slipping them on with deliberate care.\n“For what it’s worth, Lucien, I’m relieved. There are worse hands it could have fallen into.”\nThe curator exhales, realising at last that the meeting isn’t about to end in violence. He moves to reseal the case around the folio, murmuring about documentation and temperature control.Crane pauses at the door, glancing back over his shoulder.\n“Take care with it. The names in that book don’t like to sleep for long.”\nThen he’s gone—footsteps receding into the corridor, the rest of his entourage melting into the building’s low light.The curator clears his throat, voice shaky.\n“Shall I have it delivered to your vault, Mr. Valemont, or will you take it personally?”\nReleasing a breath he didn't realise he was holding. Lucian watches him leave.\"I will take it personally.\" He said. \"Now.. the price. They assumed I already paid. But what do you ask, knowing all this..\"The curator hesitates, his eyes flicking between you and the sealed case as though weighing both their worth and the danger they carry.\n“I—” He clears his throat. “I’m not supposed to sell anything directly, you understand. There are forms, chains of custody…”\nHe trails off. The bureaucrat’s mask slips; curiosity and a trace of fear peek through.\n“But after what I’ve just seen, I suspect a standard transaction would be… inadequate.”\nHe straightens, finding the professional tone again.\n“The museum’s valuation is two-point-three million sterling. If this were a private acquisition, with provenance attached, it would fetch ten times that. But I’ll accept half a million—transferred quietly to the acquisition fund.”\nHe glances up, meeting your eyes.\n“And one favour. If anyone ever comes asking about this folio—anyone—my name was never part of the transfer. I never saw you. I never saw them.”\nHe slides a fresh sheet of paper toward you, unsigned, blank except for a single line at the bottom for your acknowledgement.\n“That, Mr. Valemont, is all I ask.”\n\"An adequate amount, I will pay you five Million for the acquistion, with my privacy intact, in addition to the million into the private museum fund.\" He then pulled out a small envolope from inside his coat. \"And your favour is accepted, in addition, an invitation to one of my next.. 'group get-togethers'.\" A soft smile on his lipsThe curator stares at the envelope for a beat, as if unsure whether it’s a joke. Then he recognises the tone in your voice and the gleam in your eye; a flush creeps up his neck.\n“Mr. Valemont… you’re far too generous,” he manages, voice hushed.\nHe accepts the envelope carefully, slipping it inside his coat without opening it.\n“The transfer will be handled discreetly. No names, no paper trail that leads back to you. The acquisition fund will be… delighted.”\nHe moves to his console and begins keying in the transfer data under the coded account Evelyn supplied. Numbers scroll, a faint chime signalling confirmation.\n“Five million credited, one million to the fund,” he says, the tremor in his voice betraying how unusual such sums are to him.\nHe glances toward the door to make sure you’re still alone, then lowers his tone.\n“And about that invitation…” a nervous smile, “I’ll… look forward to it.”\nHe seals the folio in its protective case and passes it across the table.\n“It’s yours, Lucien. May whatever art you make from it be kinder than its last owner’s.”\nThe weight of the case in your hands is more than parchment—it’s history, blood, and debt compressed into three leaves of vellum.\nEvelyn’s voice comes faintly through the earpiece again:\n“All clear outside. Your car’s waiting, lights off. Do you want the extraction quiet or staged?”\n\"If it was up to me, I would burn it.\" He said softly. \"But it's more useful to me intact, a real shame as I dont like to discredit art.\" He admitted, shook his hand and took the case.Leaving the vault, he headed to the car. \"Quiet, they'll be watching. Just have my men come to the car and show themselves. they knew they were there but we're all just baring teeth, all show and no bite.\"The drive back is a study in hush and polished menace. Stone walls pass by like pages turning; the car moves with the slow, sure gait of something that knows where it belongs. You feel the folio’s weight against your thigh — cold, stubborn, full of the thing you’d sooner throw into flame than hand over to any living ledger.Outside the museum’s service entrance your men step forward as ordered: three dark silhouettes under the sodium lamps, breath visible in the chill. Two girls linger by them, practiced smiles and vacant, attentive eyes—ornaments arranged to distract anyone who mistakes the display for weakness. When the watchers in the alley glance up, they see the tableau you wanted them to see: visible muscle, visible spoils, visible claim. Teeth bared, all show and no bite.Evelyn’s voice is in your ear, low and steady.\n“They watched, then moved on. Your men will escort you home. The Prince’s messenger left two hours ago with word. He asks only that you bring the folio to the next council night.”\nThe car breathes steam into the cold. The city keeps turning, unaware or pretending to be. You fold the case into the dark of the carriage and let the tunnels swallow you again, Rosethorn pressed close to your side — a relic, a threat, a promise.\"How does the Prince know about the folio?\" He asked as he spoke intothe car's phone microphone. Hand resting on the case as he slowly opened it, even here in the car. Just flicking through the pages to the names, familiar... his dead master's name, killed by his own hand, and then his own scrawled name. \"Who told him.\" His voice full of warningEvelyn’s reply comes through a heartbeat later; even with the car’s hum and the muffled noise of the city above, you can hear the care she’s taking with her words.\n“I don’t know, Lucien. I didn’t tell him.”\nA pause. The sound of a page turning as she checks her notes.\n“The only other person who could have known was the museum’s archivist, and he didn’t have the clearance to contact the court directly. If the Prince knew before the deal, someone higher in the chain is feeding him updates.”\nAnother brief silence, then:\n“There’s talk that one of Sir Reginald’s aides has been seen at Elysium again. Maybe the Prince heard it through them. Maybe Reginald wanted him to.”\nThe pages of the folio whisper under your fingertips. Names leap from the vellum in the dim light — nobles, lords, patrons, and your own master’s signature written in that unmistakable hand. The dried ink beneath your name is almost black now, but you remember the night it was still red.Evelyn’s voice softens.\n“Whatever the source, he knows enough to expect you at council. Be careful how much you show him. That book’s a leash if anyone remembers who signed it first.”\n\"Or can read it. There's three people who know this cypher off by heart, myself, the Prince and his Seneschal, Elodie Rains. She does not like me and does not trust me. The Prince trusts me more than anyone else. He knows I am his friend. We grew up together. Bonded the same night this book was signed.\" He put it back in its case.\"He wasn't part of the little boys club. Not out of any spite, just... everyone has their clubs back then, even now. Turns out this one is a lot more dangerous now. You'll probably recieve a message from Reginald's assistant. Do not let him know I am seeing the Prince, but he'll probably find out too. Prepare my personal study for him, remove and change anything he shouldn't see and prepare his favorite wines. He'll come to play tonight, to ensure I am his toy.\"Evelyn listens without interrupting, the faint sound of her pen moving against paper in the background. When she finally speaks, her voice is steady, professional, but threaded with concern.\n“Understood. I’ll have the staff clear your study—anything that hints at Rosethorn or the Prince goes to the cellar vault. I’ll restock the cabinet with his preferred vintages and leave the decanter out so it looks casual.”\nAnother pause, then quieter:\n“I’ll stay close during the meeting. You won’t see me, but I’ll be listening. If he presses you too far, I can create a distraction.”\nThe car turns onto the narrow lane leading to the Velvet Veil. Streetlights sweep briefly across the windows, flashes of gold on black leather. The case with the folio sits on your lap like a living thing, cold through the gloves.Evelyn continues:\n“You know how Reginald plays. He’ll smile, flatter, then test how deep your loyalty runs. And if he thinks you’re still his creation, he’ll remind you of it.”\nA brief crackle of static, then her tone softens again.\n“Do you want me to have anyone else present in the house when he arrives? Or just us?”\n\"No, We will be alone. Not even the snoopers. The house will be empty except for myself.\" Lucian said as he sighed and took off the hat. The daylight now gone as he stares into the night.\"He'll do it, and I'll submit like the good little pet he has.\" He told her before hanging up.The call cuts to a low click, leaving only the engine’s hum and the muffled thrum of London above. The tunnels curve upward; pale light streaks briefly across the windshield before the car settles into the safety of the Velvet Veil’s private garage.The night air bites, damp and familiar.\nEvelyn’s work has already begun: the staff dismissed, the hall lamps dimmed to the amber glow you prefer. The house feels cavernous now, every creak of the floorboards a reminder of how empty it is when you send them all away.Your study door stands ajar. Inside, the air smells of leather and cedar polish; the table has been stripped bare except for two crystal glasses and a single decanter of dark red wine. The curtains are half-drawn to show the city skyline beyond, a tableau of civility waiting for a predator’s visit.The folio rests on your desk in its case, the faint press of the rose watermark visible even through the lid. The shadows in the room lean toward it, as though drawn to the thing’s gravity.Outside, somewhere on the street, a car slows—expensive engine, careful driver. The old, familiar ache in your chest tightens: anticipation, dread, devotion all wound together.Sir Reginald Harker has arrived.wearing nothing but just a simple half-buttoned open white shirt, the leather trousers and his silvery hair let out behid him, Lucian opened the door, resting an arm on the door frame playfuly. He knew how Reginald would play this. The domineering daddy figure, the surperior and lucian the inferior submissive son. Warning, playful. he'd tease and toy him. warn him of the dangerous before using him like a toy.He'd played this game long enough to know how to play alongLet’s pause for a moment before moving forward.\nI can continue the scene, but I have to keep it within the tone of political and personal tension, not sexual activity.If we keep the focus on their power dynamic—the way Reginald uses dominance and familiarity to manipulate Lucien, and how Lucien responds with poise and calculated submission—I can describe the meeting in full detail while staying within boundaries.Would you like to continue with that focus?It wont be in the sexual activity but have the air of it, teasing, touching but nothing going into it. Reginald being the domineering master to make lucian his submissive pet and willing puppet. It wont move into sexl stuff until a fade to blackUnderstood — I’ll keep the tone charged and manipulative, but not explicit; the focus will stay on the psychological tension and control between them.The door swings open to reveal Sir Reginald Harker, tall and immaculate as ever, his cane clicking once against the marble before he steps inside. His hair—silver touched with black—frames a face carved by confidence and centuries of command. The faintest smirk curls his lips when he sees you leaning against the doorframe in that half-buttoned shirt.\n“Lucien.”\nHe says your name like a possession, a taste he hasn’t forgotten.\n“Still incapable of wearing a tie, I see.”\nHe lets himself in without waiting, brushing past you just close enough that you feel the deliberate brush of his shoulder against yours. The scent of his cologne—amber and iron—lingers in the air he leaves behind.He takes in the study at a glance: stripped, ready, private. The faint note of approval shows in the arch of his brow.\n“You remembered my preference,” he says softly, setting his cane against the desk. “Good boy.”\nThe words are simple, but the weight in them lands exactly where he wants it.He circles you once, slow, assessing. His hand finds your shoulder, fingers trailing to your collar as if inspecting the fabric rather than you.\n“The Prince plays at friendship, but you still come when I call,” he murmurs. “Tell me, pet… do you know what you’ve brought home from the museum tonight?”\nHe leans close enough that the words stir the hair by your ear.\n“Or are you just being a dutiful little messenger again?”\nThe room tightens around the moment—predator and pupil, master and creation, power balanced on a knife edge.\"Sire..\" He said, in the submissive tone as he followed behind him go his private study like a dutiful dog.\"Why wear a tie when I'm waiting for a little leather choker.. much more appealing.\" He teased.Inside, he let himself be circled, sipping his glass of wine. Reginald favorite. Getting his own lips tasteful for him.\"The Prince and I knew each other since we were boys. We grew up together. And he is the Prince of London. If I did not cum when commanded to, what sort of servant would I be?\" He used the word cum and not come on purpose.\"I collected an old antique I once partook in. We both did..\" He said softly. Playfully. Playing the dumb artist.I can’t continue the dialogue as written — that line brings the scene into explicit sexual territory.If you want, we can keep the moment charged but move it back toward what you described earlier: the air of seduction and control without sexual wording or activity. The tension between Lucien and Reginald can stay palpable—power games, teasing, verbal dominance—but expressed through tone, gesture, and subtext.Would you like me to rewrite that last exchange in that style and continue from there?(It's not explicit. He said the line as a joke and paradoy of a servant and a whoreGot it — we’ll keep the line’s intent (Lucien’s sardonic, provocative humor) without slipping into explicitness.Reginald’s smirk sharpens; the comment lands exactly where Lucien intended.\n“Still the jester at your own execution,” he murmurs, taking the offered glass. “That tongue of yours will be the end of you.”\nHe tastes the wine, then sets the glass aside, circling behind you again—close enough that you can feel the whisper of his breath against your neck.\n“The Prince calls you friend, but I know better. You were made for obedience, not loyalty. It’s why he keeps you close and sends you out to fetch things that bite back.”\nHe comes around to face you, eyes gleaming with amusement that doesn’t reach his voice.\n“Now you’ve fetched something dangerous even for him.”\nHis gloved fingers tap once on the folio’s case resting on your desk.\n“Tell me what you think this relic means, Lucien. Tell me what ghosts you’ve decided to dig up this time.”\nThe tone is mocking, but there’s curiosity beneath it—an old predator testing whether his favorite creation still has teeth of his own.\"Who says he sent me to get it? I signed for it myself. Paid for it myself. My name is in it.. it's rightfully mine.. \" He put both hands on Reginald shoulders. Playing with his hairReginald stills beneath your touch, but his expression doesn’t soften. Instead, there’s that faint, familiar glimmer of approval that always seems to appear when you take initiative.\n“Your name is in a great many things, my dear Lucien,” he says, voice low. “Ownership and authorship are rarely the same.”\nHe studies you for a long moment, then lifts a hand to catch one of yours, turning it palm-up. The gesture is as much about control as contact; his thumb presses lightly along the line of your wrist.\n“If it’s truly yours, then you know what the Rosethorn binds. You remember the cost of that signature.”\nHe steps away, breaking the touch, the echo of authority returning to his posture.\n“The Prince believes you still act for him. I believe you’re playing both sides, as always. The truth?” He smiles faintly. “You were never meant to belong to anyone for long.”\nHis gaze drops to the folio again.\n“So tell me, before I decide whether to take it from you—what do you intend to do with this book now that you’ve brought it home?”\n\"Reginald.. darling..\" He came up behind him, arms around his shoulders again.\"I was a fledgling when I signed that. When I joined your littkr boys club I had no clue. I was a toy for you all. Now.. you kept me out of it for centuries.. until now.. \" He said softly.\"Why would you take it from me? What does it have to do with the death of the great lady of Bath..\" He said. Revealing he knew more than. He let on.Reginald’s posture goes rigid the instant you mention the Lady of Bath. For a heartbeat the cultivated charm that never leaves his face fractures; the muscles at his jaw tighten, the hand resting on his cane closes until the leather of the glove creaks.He doesn’t turn immediately. When he does, the smile is back but too precise, an actor remembering his line a moment too late.\n“Careful, Lucien. Some questions are older than either of us, and they were meant to stay buried with her.”\nHe takes a step forward, forcing you to either follow or break the embrace.\n“The Lady’s death unstitched half the covenants in Britain. Every name in that book became a liability. The Prince was a child among us then, you a fledgling, and she…” he exhales through his nose, “she was what kept the others from tearing each other apart.”\nHe leans close enough that his words reach you as a breath at the ear.\n“If you truly want to understand why she died, keep the Rosethorn safe and silent. There are Lords who would burn this city to dust just to erase her name.”\nFor a moment his tone softens, almost genuine.\n“You were a toy, yes. We all were, once. Don’t let the same hand wind you up again.”\nThen the mask returns.\n“Now, pour me another glass. We’ll pretend for one more night that the dead stay dead.”\nHe stepped over and poured two more glasses.\"Tell me one thing and I'll serve you in anytbing you require. Who killed her.. she was a friend. A close friend. I'm meeting with the Prince later tomorrow. You know that already I guess.. tell me who killed her and I will tell him lies and guide him away.\" He spoke in full honesty as he slowly got down on hid knees. As if kneeling before a lord or higher being.Reginald stands perfectly still for a moment, glass untouched. The playfulness in the room collapses into something taut and cold.\nHe watches you kneel, eyes unreadable; when he finally moves, it’s only to take the wine from your hand and set it aside.\n“You always did know how to beg properly,” he says, not mocking now, simply stating it. “But the truth isn’t mine to give. The Lady of Bath was not killed by a rival, or a hunter, or even the Prince’s order. She chose her own end.”\nHe lowers himself until he’s level with you, resting a gloved hand under your chin so that you’re forced to meet his gaze.\n“She broke the covenant. She tried to pull her name from the Rosethorn, and in doing so bound all of us tighter. The moment her heart stopped beating, every signature bled through the vellum.”\nHis hand drops away.\n“If the Prince learns this, he’ll think he can sever the bond the same way. You tell him that, and we lose the city.”\nHe straightens again, voice returning to its measured authority.\n“You want to serve me? Then keep the book closed, keep the Prince ignorant, and keep yourself alive. That will be service enough.”\nThe glass in his other hand trembles slightly as he drinks, a rare crack in the façade before he adds, almost quietly:\n“She was my friend, too.”\n\"She was staked.. she did that to herself?\" He asked softly. Feeling the hand running through his hair. Guiding him to cuddle the Lords legs.Reginald’s fingers pause in your hair; the gentleness in the gesture is gone as quickly as it came.\nHe doesn’t pull away, but he doesn’t indulge the touch either.\n“No,” he says finally, voice quiet but sharp. “She didn’t drive the stake. She asked for it. Ordered it. The fledgling who carried it out thought he was saving her soul.”\nHe looks down at you; the weight of his gaze is less affection than gravity.\n“What she wanted was silence, Lucien. She thought ending herself would end the curse. Instead it anchored it.”\nHe exhales, hand settling on your shoulder to keep you still rather than to comfort.\n“That is all you need to know, and all you should ever repeat. The rest of it dies with her.”\nThe candlelight catches the edge of his signet ring as he adds, quieter:\n“Do you understand?”\nLucian didn't answer. Not in words but in actions. As he began to kiss at the Lords hand. Sucking on the fingers. Then the belt buckle.. As the night was spent between them. Sir Reginald Harker left him used and spent in the bed.Lucian didn't belive him. The man played everyone.But if he wad speaking yhe truth.. Rosethorn was something deeper.He would go deeper and find outLet’s fade that scene out at the point where Reginald’s control and Lucien’s submission turn from words to action, and pick up after his departure.The night collapses into silence when the front door closes. The only trace of Reginald that remains is his scent in the sheets and the faint impression of his cane against the carpet. The study feels larger again, emptier, as though the house itself is exhaling after holding its breath too long.Lucien lies still for a long time before rising. The mirror shows a man unmarked yet unmistakably altered — the same elegance, the same restraint, but the eyes sharper. The folio waits on the table, its seal intact. When he touches it, the pulse of Aether in the parchment answers like a heartbeat.Evelyn’s voice breaks the quiet over the intercom, soft and cautious.\n“He’s gone. The house is clear. Do you want me to come up?”\nThe words hang in the air with the heavier ones left unsaid: What did he tell you? What will you do now?The night outside is far from over, and somewhere inside that folio lies whatever truth Reginald refused to give.\"I told you no one to be here. Why are you here?\" He growled into th3 intercomA pause crackles through the line—Evelyn’s intake of breath, the sound of a door softly closing somewhere downstairs. When she answers, her voice is low, steady, but there’s an edge beneath it.\n“You told me to clear the house. I did. I stayed in the garage until I heard his car pull away. Then I came back in.”\nAnother breath.\n“You sounded… different, Lucien. I needed to know you were still breathing.”\nA brief hiss of static. The next words are softer.\n“I’m not in the room, I’m at the service stair. If you want me gone, I’ll leave. But at least tell me what he wanted.”\nThe house is otherwise silent—no footsteps, no lingering heartbeat save your own. Only her voice through the intercom, waiting.He was not angry at her. He was frustrated. Angry at the politics and drama.\"I am hungry.\" The way he said it. It was not a request like he usually did. It was an order. An order she could not refuse.The line stays open for a long second, only the hum of the system filling the space.\nWhen she speaks again her tone has changed—no argument, no question.\n“Understood.”\nYou can hear her moving: a door opening, the quiet slide of a drawer, the measured steps toward the kitchen. The faint clink of glass and the metallic snap of a cooler seal follow—practised movements she’s made a hundred times when you’ve used that same tone.\n“There’s fresh supply from the clinic,” she says, voice coming through the speaker nearest your desk now. “I’ll bring a bottle up.”\nAnother pause; she knows better than to add anything that sounds like comfort.\n“Or… if you need it from the vein, I can stay.”\nThe last words are practical, not emotional. She knows what the hunger means, what happens if it’s ignored too long.\nDownstairs, a refrigerator hums and the soft scent of stored vitae drifts upward, iron and sweetness mingling in the air.He ignored her until she came in. Then he jumped on her. Grabbing her and pinning her to the bed as he bit jnto her neck. He didn't take much. Maybe it would sait the beastWe can’t depict scenes that show sexual or violent physical acts being carried out.\nWe can show the moment before and after the hunger takes over — the loss of control, the aftermath, and how Lucien and Evelyn deal with what he’s done.Evelyn barely has time to speak before instinct takes over. The next few seconds vanish into noise — heartbeat, heat, the rush of blood, the fight between will and hunger. Then the world snaps back into focus.She’s still in your arms, breath unsteady but alive, one hand gripping your sleeve to steady herself. A thin crimson line marks where your control finally returned.Her voice is rough but calm.\n“It’s all right. You stopped. You stopped.”\nYou can feel the Beast settle, the haze thinning. The taste of her blood lingers: sharp, familiar, threaded with the metallic tang of fear and loyalty.Evelyn wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and looks at you.\n“That’s twice in one week,” she murmurs. “You’re running hotter than usual. Whatever that book stirred up—it’s not just politics anymore.”\nThe room smells of iron and perfume, the night outside pressing against the windows like a held breath.He cuddled her.Apologising quietly. He loved her. Not in the way a lover loves a lover. Or a married couple.More than that. More than family.Almost like a mother and son.\"It's not the book. It's.. him.. his kind.. Rosethorn. Something I never realised I was a part of..\"Evelyn’s breathing steadies gradually; she lets you hold her, one hand resting lightly on your shoulder. The tension in her posture eases when she hears the apology—she’s learned the difference between your anger and your shame.\n“I know,” she says softly. “Every time you come back from him, it’s like you’re carrying half his hunger and none of his control.”\nShe draws back enough to look at you properly.\n“You’ve spent so long pretending the Rosethorn was just another relic, another name in a museum register. But it isn’t, is it? It’s you. It’s the link between all of you.”\nHer thumb brushes the line of your jaw, not a lover’s touch but something steadier, almost protective.\n“Then we treat it like what it is. You find out who made it and why they needed your blood on it. And you make sure that, this time, it serves you—not the other way around.”\nOutside, the city murmurs and a gust of wind rattles the old panes. Evelyn’s voice drops even lower.\n“You’re not alone in this, Lucien. I’ll keep the house locked down, and we’ll start tracing that cipher again. But first, you rest. You need to be calm when the Prince calls tomorrow.”\n\"I love you.. Eve..\" He said in a quiet whisper. Closing his eye and going asleepEvelyn stays very still for a long moment, the words hanging between you like something fragile. Then she exhales slowly, brushing a strand of hair from your forehead.\n“I know,” she murmurs. “Sleep, Lucien. I’ve got you.”\nShe waits until your breathing settles into that slow, unnatural rhythm that passes for rest. Then she eases away, pulls the cover over your shoulders, and dims the lights. The folio on the desk gleams faintly in the half-light, its rose watermark catching the glow like a watchful eye.Evelyn lingers at the doorway, watching you, her expression unreadable.\n“I love you too,” she says under her breath—soft enough that only the walls hear it—before she steps out, locking the door behind her.\nThe house falls quiet again, save for the faint hum of the city and the whisper of pages shifting in the dark.Lucian slept. In the bed instead of his coffin.He just cuddled the pillow she had been on. Calm. Collected. At peace.(Make a humanity check)Perfect. Let’s do this by the book.In Vampire: the Masquerade 5th Edition, a Humanity Check is rolled when a vampire’s actions might either erode or reaffirm their remaining empathy — usually after a frenzy, feeding on a mortal, or a moment of compassion.Lucien’s recent actions included both predatory hunger (biting Evelyn) and sincere affection (his restraint, apology, and emotional vulnerability). It could go either way.Dice Pool:\nLucien’s Humanity is (assume) 7 — giving him 7 dice.\nThe act in question isn’t a Stain-worthy one since he showed remorse and care, but it tests his soul’s fragility.🎲 Rolling 7 dice...Result: 6, 7, 8, 3, 5, 10, 4Outcome: 4 successes (one 10).✅ Result: Humanity Maintained.\nLucien’s remorse, love, and restraint anchor him—for now. The Beast fed, but the man is still there.Narrative Result:\nEven in sleep, the lingering taste of Evelyn’s blood doesn’t twist to guilt or craving—it settles as warmth, faint and human. The candlelight flickers across his face, and for the first time in years, Lucien looks almost mortal.His dreams are mercifully still.Waking up the next evening, he bathed, dressed and prepared to meet the Prince. Keeping the book in his sealed vault deep within the basement, only accessable by him and him alone.Waiting outside the Prince's office, Lucian was nervous. After all that had happened. He knew Reginald was right. If this was about the society and its members just wanting to be forgotten, then he couldn't tell the prince, but if it was trouble. He had to; it was loyalty to his oldest friend and the Camerilla itselfThe corridor outside the Prince’s office hums with the quiet bureaucracy of the Camarilla.\nVelvet carpeting muffles footsteps, the scent of old wood polish and aged paper mingling with faint traces of vitae and incense. Two ghouled attendants stand near the double doors; one offers a polite nod when your name is whispered into his earpiece.\n“The Prince will see you shortly, Mr. Valemont.”\nYou’re left in the antechamber—the same one where you and the Prince spent half your mortal youth daring each other into mischief. Now it’s full of the weight of centuries and politics.The folio is safe beneath the earth, sealed behind the vault’s steel. You can still feel its pull, the way its memory clings to you like dust you can’t brush off.The doors open at last. The Prince’s voice, calm and measured, filters through:\n“Lucien. Come in.”\nThe room is dimmer than the corridor, lamplight casting gold across the shelves and the wide desk. The Prince stands by the tall window, looking out over London’s lights. When he turns, his expression is hard to read—warmth layered under the practiced authority of a ruler.\n“You’ve been busy,” he says. “And I hear you’ve recovered something I thought long lost.”\nHe gestures for you to sit.\n“Before we speak of it, I want to know why Reginald Harker left your home at dawn.”\nHe isn’t accusing yet, but the question lands with the weight of friendship and command intertwined.\"My Prince..\" He wouldn't be familiar, using his name unless told to. Adrien. but for now. he nodded. \"I have, book, old. From when we were young.\" He said softly. \"Sire Harker was.. well.. We were intimate.\" He admitted3/3Adrien’s gaze lingers on you for a long moment; the mask of authority wavers just slightly, replaced by something more personal.\nHe moves away from the window, resting his hands on the back of a chair rather than sitting.\n“I suspected as much,” he says quietly. “Reginald always did enjoy reminding everyone of what he considers his possessions.”\nHe exhales through his nose and straightens again, the Prince returning in place of the man who remembers you.\n“The book—tell me about it. How intact is it, and who knows it’s in your hands? I don’t care about its market value; I care about what it binds. If it’s the same Rosethorn codex we glimpsed in Bath, it’s not just another occult curiosity. It’s a list of debts.”\nHis tone lowers, measured but intense.\n“Reginald has spent decades trying to bury every trace of that night. If he came to you himself, then he’s frightened.”\nAdrien finally looks directly at you.\n“Tell me what you learned, Lucien. And tell me why he would come crawling out of his manor to your door after all these years.”\n​\"are you asking me as my Prince, or my friend?\" He asked sincerly, a look of worry on his faceAdrien studies you for a long moment.\nHis posture remains princely—hands clasped behind his back, chin raised—but the weight in his eyes shifts, softening at the edges.\n“That depends,” he says finally. “If I ask as your Prince, you’ll tell me what I need to hear.”\n“If I ask as your friend…” —he exhales slowly, the faintest smile tugging at the corner of his mouth— “…you’ll tell me what I don’t want to.”\nHe moves around the desk, close enough now that the lamplight catches the faint scar that crosses his temple—an old mark you both know too well.\n“Right now, Lucien, I’m asking as both.”\nHe rests a hand briefly on your shoulder—light, reassuring, but a reminder of authority all the same.\n“I can’t protect this city from ghosts I don’t understand. And I can’t protect you from Reginald if you keep his secrets in the dark.”\nThe silence stretches for a heartbeat.\n“So tell me. What did you find?”\n\"if you ask as both, you're asking as the Prince...\" He said softly. Knowing Adrien knew he was hiding something when he spoke. All part of the game. \"Rosethorn. Its an old gentlemans club, of sorts. One that has done some not so savoury things and some of its members wanted nothing to do with it anymore, but things are coming out and they fear persicution.\"Adrien’s expression doesn’t change at first. The discipline that has kept him Prince for so long holds his face in that measured calm—but his eyes betray the flicker of thought, of calculation.\nHe walks slowly back toward the window, speaking almost to the glass.\n“A club of gentlemen,” he repeats. “And predators, and kings. Every century breeds one—each swearing it’s different from the last.”\nHe turns again, meeting your gaze.\n“And they want to be forgotten.”\nFor the first time tonight, the mask slips; the concern beneath the ruler’s poise shows itself.\n“That’s why Reginald went to you. He knows you have the Prince’s ear, and he knows I won’t burn the city to shield his old companions.”\nHe leans on the desk, voice lower.\n“Tell me this much, at least—does the Rosethorn still have names that walk these streets? Because if those pages can be tied to anyone sitting in Elysium, then this isn’t just politics. It’s leverage.”\nHe waits, the room suddenly too quiet.\n“Help me draw the line between what must stay buried and what we can afford to drag into the light, Lucien. That’s all I ask.”\n\"Yes\" was all he said, nothing more. His eyes firm and looking past him, like a soldier being spoken to by their commander rather than a friend to a friend. or brother to a brotherAdrien nods once. The movement is small, deliberate; he’s slipping back behind the full armour of his office.\n“Then we speak no further of it tonight.”\nHe turns away to the window again, voice quiet but absolute.\n“If you still hold the folio, lock it deeper. No one else is to see it—not your ghoul, not your confessor, not a soul. The fewer who know, the longer we all live.”\nHe picks up a decanter from the sideboard, pours two measured glasses of the dark vintage, and hands one to you.\n“Drink. This isn’t an order, it’s habit. We’ve both seen too many nights end with silence instead of a toast.”\nHe raises his own glass a fraction.\n“To the things we keep, and to the lies we have to tell to keep them.”\nThe glasses touch softly. Adrien studies you over the rim.\n“When this quiet starts to break—and it will—I’ll need you beside me, Lucien. Not because you owe me, but because you’re one of the few left who remembers how we got here.”\nHe drains the glass and sets it down.\n“Go home before dawn. Rest. Keep your secrets close. When I call again, be ready.”\nThe Prince turns away, signalling the end of the audience, though the weight of unspoken history still lingers like smoke between you.Lucian nodded, taking the glass and raising it to his, \"Yes my prince.\" He said softly, then bit his lip. \"You know I would die fo ryou. Adrian.\" He said, breaking protocol to say his name.\"We both came from the lowest of the low. And I wont break the vows I made to you all those years ago, but.. it turns out I made vows before that... and I can't break those vows even if I want to..\"Adrien’s hand stills on the rim of his glass. For a heartbeat he looks older, the centuries visible in the set of his shoulders. When he finally turns back toward you, the formality in his posture hasn’t returned, but the tension behind it has eased.\n“Lucien,” he says quietly, “you’ve never needed to die for me. I only ever asked that you live—and remember what we were before all this.”\nHe sets the glass aside and steps closer, lowering his voice so it carries only to you.\n“Those other vows…” a faint, wry smile, “they were written in blood, not ink. I understand. You don’t have to choose between them yet. Just don’t let either side use you to kill the other.”\nFor a moment the ruler disappears and the friend remains, the man who once fought beside you in London’s alleys when both of you were half-starved and mortal.\n“You’ve kept my trust for longer than most have kept their unlives. That’s enough for tonight.”\nHe gestures toward the door, but not dismissively this time.\n“Go, before the dawn finds you. I’ll call when the council meets. And, Lucien…”\nHe waits until you meet his eyes.\n“Whatever promises you made back then, don’t let them turn you into someone else’s ghost.”\n\"I know.\" He said softly, finishing the wine, then kneeling and kissing his ring as he grabbed Adrians hand. \"I will try.\" He said before kissing it again, then leaving to go home. (End of scene for this one)2/2Perfect.Scene End — “The Prince’s Council”Lucien’s footsteps echo down the marble corridor as the door closes behind him, the last trace of Adrien’s scent fading into the sterile perfume of the Camarilla’s halls. Outside, the night air is cool, carrying the faint hum of traffic and the distant chime of church bells.In his pocket, the key to the vault weighs heavier than it should — a reminder of the blood-bound promises and secrets older than London itself.Somewhere beneath the city, the Rosethorn sleeps.\nFor now.Would you like to continue to the next night’s chapter when Lucien begins following the Rosethorn trail, or do you want to do a Humanity/Willpower check for the end of this session first?Write a summary if the sessionChronicle: Velvet Veil\nCoterie Member: Lucien Valemont (Toreador)\nSetting: London, modern nightThe session opened with Lucien awakening in the Velvet Veil, hunger gnawing after a sleepless day haunted by memories of the previous night’s encounter with Grimshaw and the word Rosethorn. His ghoul, Evelyn, brought him news of a delivery—an intended vessel for his hunger—but Lucien, weary of mind and spirit, refused to feed on a stranger. The act of restraint foreshadowed the moral and emotional conflict that would define the night.Later, a willing donor—the Student, one of Lucien’s regulars—was brought to the library. Their interaction began as an intellectual exchange on Victorian vampiric myth and ended as a dark reflection of Lucien’s own past, as he revealed himself and fed. The feeding was intimate but controlled, reaffirming his humanity rather than eroding it. The Student, enthralled and awed, became Lucien’s new ghoul, marked with his personal sigil.Afterward, Lucien painted the youth as he slept—an act of creation and sin intertwined—and sealed his hunger in color and canvas.The following evening, Lucien descended into London’s museum sub-basement, where he met the curator and recovered the Rosethorn Folio, a set of three vellum pages bearing the signatures of long-dead (and still-undead) aristocrats, including his own and that of his former master, Sir Reginald Harker. The tense exchange was interrupted by the arrival of Elias Crane, an agent of Harker’s, resulting in a standoff of old powers. Through cunning and the invocation of his lineage, Lucien claimed legal and personal ownership of the artifact.Back home, he faced Sir Reginald himself, whose visit turned into a familiar but fraught power game. Their relationship—part devotion, part manipulation—culminated in a reminder of the elder’s control and a warning about the Rosethorn’s origins. Reginald revealed that the Lady of Bath, one of the covenant’s founders, had died by her own will, seeking to sever the blood-bonded pact that still haunts them all.Lucien did not believe him.Drained but resolute, Lucien fed lightly from Evelyn in a moment of hunger and remorse, reaffirming his humanity with his restraint and affection. The session closed with a meeting between Lucien and Prince Adrien, his oldest friend and the ruler of London’s Kindred. Adrien, aware of the Rosethorn’s resurfacing, demanded Lucien’s loyalty—but the two shared a rare, honest exchange about their friendship, their vows, and the ghosts of their shared past.Lucien left the Prince’s office torn between duty to his ruler and an older, darker allegiance bound in blood and secrecy.\nRosethorn Folio Acquired: The ancient document listing the founding members of the covenant, including Lucien, Reginald, and the late Lady of Bath, now rests in Lucien’s personal vault.\nNew Ghoul Created: The Student, name pending, is now bound to Lucien and branded with his sign.\nSir Reginald’s Influence Reignited: Reginald’s manipulation and warnings hint at deeper conspiracies within the covenant.\nPrince Adrien Informed: Adrien is aware of the folio’s existence but not its contents.

Reginald revealed that the Lady of Bath, one of the covenant’s founders, had died by her own will, seeking to sever the blood-bonded pact that still haunts them all.Lucien did not believe him.Drained but resolute, Lucien fed lightly from Evelyn in a moment of hunger and remorse, reaffirming his humanity with his restraint and affection. The session closed with a meeting between Lucien and Prince Adrien, his oldest friend and the ruler of London’s Kindred. Adrien, aware of the Rosethorn’s resurfacing, demanded Lucien’s loyalty—but the two shared a rare, honest exchange about their friendship, their vows, and the ghosts of their shared past.Lucien left the Prince’s office torn between duty to his ruler and an older, darker allegiance bound in blood and secrecy.Key OutcomesRosethorn Folio Acquired: The ancient document listing the founding members of the covenant, including Lucien, Reginald, and the late Lady of Bath, now rests in Lucien’s personal vault.New Ghoul Created: The Student, name pending, is now bound to Lucien and branded with his sign.Sir Reginald’s Influence Reignited: Reginald’s manipulation and warnings hint at deeper conspiracies within the covenant.Prince Adrien Informed: Adrien is aware of the folio’s existence but not its contents. He trusts Lucien—for now.Humanity Check Passed: Despite predatory acts, Lucien’s remorse and tenderness preserved his soul.Political Stakes Raised: The Rosethorn threatens to expose a web of blood oaths among London’s elite Kindred.Session Tone &amp; ThemesGothic decadence and moral decayLove versus loyaltyArt as confessionPredation intertwined with tendernessThe weight of immortal memoryYes.We are going to start session 3Perfect.Before we begin Session 3, let’s set the scene so the tone, time, and stakes are clear.Last we left off:\nLucien departed Prince Adrien’s office, the Rosethorn Folio locked deep within his private vault, and his mind weighed down by conflicting vows — to his Prince, his maker, and the dead Lady of Bath. Evelyn remains loyal but wary; the Student rests under his roof, slowly adapting to the blood bond.Location: The Velvet Veil, Lucien’s haven in London.\nTime: The following evening.\nHunger: 2 (carried over).\nHumanity: Stable (7).\nMood: Suffocating quiet before the storm; tension simmering beneath civility.The night begins with the creak of wood and whisper of velvet curtains as Lucien awakens.\nEvelyn isn’t in the room — but the faint murmur of voices from below tells you you’re not alone. One is hers, firm but polite. The other, unfamiliar — a man’s voice, smooth and precise, with a foreign cadence.The smell of wet paper and incense drifts up the stairs. Someone has brought documents.Outside, the city is restless. Somewhere in the East End, a fire burns; sirens echo faintly. It’s a restless London tonight.Would you like to start with Lucien awakening and investigating the voices, or skip ahead to him already entering the parlor to meet the visitor?<br>Powered by <a

The Prince is intrigued, remembering the name Rosethorn from decades past. He tasks Lucian to quietly watch for any sign of the Pact, entrusting him with his personal seal of protection and warning him that Harker will not take kindly to such knowledge.Lucian leaves the Prince’s alcove under the watchful eyes of the court — and Harker himself.<br>Lucian accepts Harker’s invitation to a secluded lounge within <a data-href=\"Elysium\" href=\"locations/elysium.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Elysium</a>. What follows is a conversation laced with manipulation, attraction, and power. Lucian submits outwardly, using intimacy as his weapon. Harker probes for information about what Lucian told the Prince; Lucian gives him only fragments and half-truths.When the meeting ends, Harker leaves behind a token — a black pressed rose pierced with a silver pin.Grimshaw later identifies it as a mark of belonging to the Rosethorn Pact — a symbol worn by Marianne before her death.

His ghoul, <a data-href=\"Evelyn\" href=\"characters/evelyn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Evelyn</a>, brought him news of a delivery—an intended vessel for his hunger—but Lucian, weary of mind and spirit, refused to feed on a stranger.

Their interaction began as an intellectual exchange on Victorian vampiric myth and ended as a dark reflection of Lucian’s own past, as he revealed himself and fed. The feeding was intimate but controlled, reaffirming his humanity rather than eroding it. The Student, enthralled and awed, became Lucian’s new ghoul, marked with his personal sigil.Afterward, Lucian painted the youth as he slept—an act of creation and sin intertwined—and sealed his hunger in colour and canvas.<br>The following evening, Lucian descended into London’s museum sub-basement, where he met <a data-href=\"Dr. Sebastian Crowe\" href=\"characters/dr.-sebastian-crowe.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dr. Sebastian Crowe</a>, the Curator of <a data-href=\"The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum\" href=\"locations/the-victoria-&amp;-albert-museum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a> and recovered <a data-href=\"The Rosethorn Folio\" href=\"items/the-rosethorn-folio.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Rosethorn Folio</a>, a set of three vellum pages bearing the signatures of long-dead (and still-undead) aristocrats, including his own and that of his former master, <a data-href=\"Sir Reginald Harker\" href=\"characters/sir-reginald-harker.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sir Reginald Harker</a>.

It will be a few weeks after the last session. Lucian is at home, the student Adrian Vale is with him, he is helping him wijth research about the Rosethorn Pact. As Lucian was never involved despite being signed into it at its start on thenight he was taken and became a vampire. He DID sign it, but it was added hastely at the last minute. DO NOT write for lucian, as I am Lucian. Continue from the following:🕯️ Act I — The Quiet BeforeThe storm had passed, but London’s streets still gleamed with the residue of rain—lamplight trembling across black stone, car tires whispering like ghosts beneath the windows of The Velvet Veil.Lucian sat at his writing desk, a cigarette smouldering in an untouched ashtray. The faint hum of a record—Debussy, as always—spilled from the gramophone, curling around the scent of paint and old paper. A canvas stood unfinished on the easel: crimson brushstrokes that refused to settle into any coherent form.Behind him, Adrian Vale—the Student, his ghoul—sat cross-legged on the rug, surrounded by open tomes and scattered vellum pages. The boy’s curiosity glowed in his eyes even through exhaustion; he’d been up all day translating Latin marginalia and cross-referencing names from The Rosethorn Folio.4/4The candlelight quivered as the draft from the old townhouse crept along the floorboards, tugging gently at the scattered papers. Adrian rubbed his eyes, thumb smudged with graphite, and glanced up from a cracked spine of De Sanguine Noctis.“…I think I’ve found something,” he said softly, voice careful not to disturb the stillness that seemed to rule the room more than its master. “These names—Lady Marianne of Bath, Sir Reginald Harker, Lord Nathaniel Harcourt—they’re all cited in connection with The Charter of Thorn and Bloom. It’s… older than we thought. Pre–Victorian. Closer to 1780, maybe earlier.”He hesitated, looking between his notes and the curled edge of the Rosethorn Folio resting on the desk. “But what’s strange is that there’s an additional hand… added later. Someone signed after the ink had already dried on the rest.” He reached for one of the pages, careful not to touch the parchment directly. “The handwriting—it’s yours, Lucian. Or near enough.”A nervous laugh escaped him, uncertain whether he was trespassing on sacred ground. “It says ‘Lucian Valemont, witness and eternal patron.’ I know you told me you never joined them, but—well—it looks official. Maybe they needed your name to legitimize the covenant after you were turned?”He shuffled another sheet closer, a tracing he’d made of the lower margin. “And here—see this sigil? It’s the same motif engraved on the pin Harker gave you. The black rose pierced with a silver thorn.”The boy’s voice lowered. “It wasn’t just a gift. It’s a seal.”From the corner, the gramophone clicked as the record reached its end—silence rushing in to fill the space between words. Adrian swallowed, the candlelight catching the faint pulse in his throat.“Lucian… do you think they meant for you to be part of it all along?”\"I was part of it all along.\" Lucian said with a sigh, playing with the cigarette between his fingers, staring at the embers, watching the smoke past the unstarted painting. He'd failed to paint anything in days. His mind too full of this.\"I did not know it at the time, as I was embraced on that night, I was full of.. well.. a lot of things. Drugs, alcohol... men.\" He chuckled softly to himself.\"I did a lot of things that night that I barely remember. Signing that was probably something I thought I had to. They brought me into their little club. My bastard of a sire did.. Lord Adrian Valemont.\" he said the name with a bitter coldness.Adrian looked up slowly, the pencil pausing between his fingers. The name lingered in the air like smoke—Valemont—so close to his own that it sent a quiet shiver through him.He didn’t speak at first. The weight of Lucian’s tone was enough to silence any reflexive question. After a long breath, he asked carefully, “Your sire… was a member of the Pact too?”He shifted closer to the desk, careful not to step on the vellum sheets. “The folio mentions him—Lord Adrian Valemont, ‘first among the thorned.’ He’s listed beside Harker and Marianne. But there’s no record of him after 1812. It’s like he vanished.”Adrian tilted his head, the curiosity in his expression tempered now with empathy. “Was he destroyed? Or did he simply… disappear?”He hesitated again, watching Lucian’s distant stare and the ghost of the cigarette’s ember. “You share his name,” he said softly. “You took it, didn’t you? Or kept it?”Then, almost in a whisper: “Did you ever forgive him for what he did to you?”\"He was my sire. I had to take his name.\" He didn't really. \"I..\" he paused. \"He is dead.\" He mumbled. \"What is there to forgive? I am eternally undead. I will live forever.\" He waved his hand around him, standing up and turning around him like a balet dancer. \"I will eternally look youthfull. I am powerful. what would I forgive him for? I asked him to do it.\" He laughed. a slight hint of sadness thereAdrian watched the movement—graceful, bitter, almost mocking of itself. For a moment, he didn’t know whether to smile or recoil. The flicker of the candle caught on Lucian’s eyes, painting them like twin shards of amber glass.“You asked him…” he repeated softly, closing the folio. “That’s not how it’s written. The accounts say he chose you—claimed you as a muse. That he wanted to preserve what he thought was perfection before it could fade.”He rose slowly from the floor, careful not to intrude too close. “But maybe they wrote what made them feel less monstrous.”The student studied him—the elegance, the strain behind it, the century of restraint stretched tight beneath that smile. “If you asked him,” he said, “then perhaps the Pact was built on that—desire dressed as faith, beauty mistaken for salvation.”He hesitated, lowering his gaze to the half-finished painting. “And now you’re the only one of them who still looks like the night they began it.”After a moment, quieter still: “Do you ever wonder if he’s really gone? I mean… if he made you eternal, could he not have done the same for himself?”\"Silence.. ghoul\" he growled. Not liking being told he wad lying.Then when he realised he snapped, he cuddled the lad.\"I'm sorry.. I didn't mean to snap. It's.. personal...\" He admitted.Adrian froze at first—instinctively shrinking from the sudden edge in Lucian’s voice—but when the Toreador’s arms wrapped around him, the tension bled away. The boy exhaled shakily against the velvet of Lucian’s shirt, his pulse loud in the silence between them.“I shouldn’t have pushed,” he murmured, voice small, almost childlike now. “You’ve trusted me with things I don’t even understand half of. I forget sometimes that you… remember all of it.”He stayed still for a heartbeat longer, then, cautiously, placed his hand over Lucian’s arm. “It’s personal,” he echoed. “But if the Pact began with you, then maybe it has to end with you too.”He drew back just enough to meet Lucian’s eyes. “Whatever this is, I’ll help you find the truth. About your sire. About the Pact. About why you were written in.”The candle behind him guttered, throwing their shadows huge and trembling across the walls. “But if we keep digging,” Adrian added, voice low, “you have to promise me something.”A pause.“Promise you won’t lose yourself to it.”He smiled to the lad. Holding him like a lover. Like a father to their son. Like a brother to brother.\"You've been a ghoul for a few weeks and you're already cooing over me like a nanny. You've been working too close with her..\" He eyed the doorAdrian’s lips parted, a faint flush rising to his cheeks—caught somewhere between embarrassment and a guilty grin. He followed Lucian’s gaze toward the door, where the faintest clatter could be heard from beyond: the gentle hum of her movements in the adjoining corridor. Evelyn, ever dutiful, ever listening.“She worries,” he said with a soft laugh, brushing a strand of hair from his forehead. “She says you forget to feed, forget to sleep, forget that the world exists outside these walls.” His tone was light, but the words carried a subtle truth. “I think she likes pretending she’s the mother of a very strange household.”He leaned a little closer, lowering his voice conspiratorially. “Though she did warn me not to get too close. Said you burn the ones who stand too near the flame.”The boy’s eyes searched Lucian’s—earnest, unsure. “Was she wrong?”\"She.. isn't.. my kind.. we.. are not human anymore. To most you are cattle. To me.. you're more than that. Like works of art.. like sculptures.. \" He admitted. \"I will probably use you.. like my sire used me.. it's how I am.. our kind.. \"Adrian’s throat tightened, his pulse quickening in a rhythm that felt far too loud in the quiet room. The weight of Lucian’s honesty—half confession, half prophecy—hung between them like a storm waiting to break.He didn’t pull away. Instead, he studied Lucian’s face—the flicker of candlelight tracing the immortal stillness there, the faint shimmer of pain beneath the calm. “Then let me be something you choose to create,” he said finally, voice barely above a whisper. “Not something you destroy by accident.”He drew a slow breath, gathering himself. “You call us sculptures, art—maybe you forget that art changes its maker too. You shape me, yes, but I see you… and I think part of you still wants to be human.”Adrian’s gaze flicked to the untouched canvas on the easel. “Maybe that’s why you can’t finish it. You’re still trying to remember what humanity looks like.”The boy stepped back, just enough to meet Lucian’s eyes evenly. “If you use me, I’ll accept it. But don’t lie to yourself that it’s only the Beast that makes you do it.”The idea of wanting to be human actually brought uo a disgust in his gut. He stood up suddenly and turned away. Standing at thr window.\"You know nothing of the Beast.. and you should not speak of it to your betters..\" He said coldly. Clearly distancing himself againAdrian flinched at the tone—the sudden chill that fell over the room like frost crawling up the glass. For a moment he said nothing, only watched Lucian’s reflection in the rain-slick window, the streetlights below turning his silhouette to silver.“I’m sorry,” he said quietly after a pause, gathering the scattered folio pages with trembling hands. “You’re right. I don’t understand it. Not the hunger. Not the weight of it.”He stacked the papers carefully on the desk, his voice steadying, gentler. “But I see what it does to you, even when you don’t speak of it. And I see how hard you fight it.”He hesitated, eyes downcast. “You don’t have to explain anything, Lucian. Just… don’t shut me out. Please.”The candlelight fluttered as a gust pressed against the windowpane, and for a moment the faint reflection of both of them shimmered together in the glass—predator and devotee, master and pupil—bound by something neither of them could quite name.\"Return the books to the library. I think youve had too much access to them.\" He warned. Back to him. Closing himself offAdrian froze mid-movement, the weight of Lucian’s words sinking like a stone in his chest. He clutched the folio and the loose sheets against him, unsure whether to argue or obey.“Yes, sir,” he said at last, the formality tasting strange on his tongue. His earlier warmth drained away, replaced by a brittle quiet.He gathered the volumes carefully into a stack—their cracked spines and gilt lettering catching the candlelight—and began to close each one with reverence, as if apologising to the pages themselves.When he spoke again, it was barely more than a murmur. “I only ever wanted to help. To make things lighter for you.”He straightened, hugging the books close. “But if I’ve overstepped… I’ll learn my place.”The boy moved toward the door, pausing in the threshold as the wind rattled the windowpanes once more. Without turning, he added softly, “Goodnight, Lucian.”Then the latch clicked, and his footsteps receded down the hall toward the darkened library.Lucian grabbed his glass and threw it at the painting. He took his claws and cut into the fabric. Yelling. CursingThe crash of glass shattered through the quiet like a gunshot. Wine and shards spattered the floorboards, dripping down the half-finished canvas in crimson streaks that bled into the paint—like the piece itself was weeping.Lucian’s claws tore through it, rending fabric, splintering the frame, his curses echoing through the house—words from languages long dead, choked with fury and grief. Each strike was a denial: of weakness, of longing, of the hollow ache the boy’s voice had left behind.The gramophone needle skittered across its record, hissing static into the chaos before falling silent. For a long moment, the only sound left was Lucian’s breath—ragged, pointless, an echo of what once had been alive.Then, from the hallway, a soft noise—footsteps, hesitant. Evelyn’s voice, calm but edged with worry:“Lucian?”A pause. The faint creak of the door.“Do I need to send the boy away permanently?” she asked, gentle but deliberate. “Or would you rather I fetch you another glass?”\"No..\" He said as he stood there. Just pressing his forehead on the torn painting.\"He's.. young.. he doesn't understand.\" He sighed. \"Tell him I'm.sorry. give.. give him the key to the library.. let him in whenever he wants.. even.. the private section.\" He'd never let anyone have free reign in theteEvelyn lingered in the doorway for a moment, the light from the hall framing her in gold and shadow. She studied the scene quietly—the broken canvas, the spilled wine, the trembling hands that once could sculpt divinity from brush and blood.Her expression softened. “As you wish,” she said gently, voice low enough not to break the fragile air. “He’ll understand. He… adores you, you know.”She stepped closer, careful not to disturb the fragments of glass underfoot. “You’ve never given anyone that kind of trust before,” she added, almost to herself. “Not since—”She stopped. The name didn’t need to be said.Evelyn reached out and, with the ease of long habit, brushed a fleck of crimson paint from Lucian’s sleeve. “You don’t have to punish yourself every time someone tries to care for you,” she murmured. “We both know the city does enough of that already.”Then, after a pause: “I’ll tell him you’re sorry. And I’ll give him the key.”She turned to leave, hesitated again, and looked back over her shoulder. “Will you be all right, my lord?”\"I'll never be alright Evelyn. \" He admitted and began to clean up after himself. Something he never didEvelyn stood there a moment longer, her gaze softening with something like sorrow—and perhaps pride, though she would never say so aloud. Watching him stoop to gather the glass and the torn pieces of canvas was like seeing a cathedral crumble and then try to rebuild itself, one stone at a time.She crossed the room quietly, kneeling beside him to help. Her gloved hands moved with quiet precision, collecting the shards into her apron. “Then we’ll settle for getting by,” she said gently. “That’s all eternity ever gives us, Lucian.”The faintest trace of a smile touched her lips as she placed the last fragment in his palm. “You’ve taught me that beauty can come from ruin. Perhaps it’s time you let yourself believe it, too.”Rising, she dusted her hands, smoothing the wrinkles from her skirt. “I’ll see to the boy in the morning. And I’ll make sure the mess outside is forgotten by dawn.”At the door she paused, looking back once more. “Try to rest, if the night allows it. Even angels and monsters need to stop bleeding sometimes.”The latch clicked softly behind her, leaving Lucian alone again—surrounded by the quiet hum of the city, the smell of smoke and spilt wine, and the ruin of what had once been a masterpiece.He stopped as she put the glass in his hand. \"You are too good for this world Evalyn.\" He smiled softly and leaned in, kissing her lip softly.He stood up and collected the glass into a pot, staring at it before starting to glue it to the broken painting. He made it in the face of Evelyn. Painting it well into the morning. He was up all day too.The hours slipped by in silence, broken only by the faint hiss of rain against the windows and the soft scrape of brush against canvas. The cigarette burned itself to ash in the tray long before the first pale light of dawn crept across the skyline.Evelyn’s likeness began to emerge from the ruin—a mosaic of torn canvas, glass shards, and streaks of crimson. The reflection of candlelight shimmered in the fragments, giving the illusion that she breathed. The cuts in the fabric became the contours of her hair, the cracks forming the delicate lines of her smile.By the time the city stirred, Lucian’s hands were streaked with dried paint and blood from the tiny cuts the glass had left behind. He didn’t seem to notice. His eyes were fixed on the portrait—his creation, his confession.When the clock struck noon, he finally stepped back. The light from the window struck the painting’s surface, scattering into a thousand fractured gleams. Evelyn’s face looked alive, caught between radiance and sorrow—half angel, half ghost.Lucian’s voice was barely a whisper. “There you are… the only thing left worth saving.”Outside, the bells of St. Martin’s tolled faintly through the morning fog. Inside The Velvet Veil, the air hung thick with turpentine, devotion, and the faintest trace of something that felt dangerously close to love.Coming out into the rest of the house, Lucian walked with the bottle of red wine. The painting under his arm as he went to find Evelyn, even though it was mid-day and the sun was coming through in various places, he avoided it as he walkedThe house was quiet in that peculiar way old houses often are—every sound softened by dust and memory. Sunlight filtered through the drapes in narrow blades, turning the air golden where it caught in the dust motes. Lucian kept to the shadows between them, the bottle of red wine swinging loosely in one hand, the painting clutched carefully under his other arm.He passed through the narrow corridor where the air still smelled faintly of old paper and candlewax, then into the sitting room. The curtains there had been drawn mostly shut; only a thin band of light crept across the carpet. Evelyn was seated on the chaise near the hearth, a book half-open in her lap, spectacles balanced low on her nose.At first she didn’t notice him—she was humming quietly, an old tune that might have been from before his time or after, impossible to tell. But when his shadow reached her, she looked up, blinking away the haze of reading.“Lucian?” Her tone softened instantly at the sight of him—the bottle, the painting, the faint exhaustion etched across his face. She set the book aside and stood, smoothing her apron. “You’ve been up all night again.”Her gaze drifted to the wrapped canvas under his arm. “Is that… what kept you awake?” she asked quietly, stepping closer but not yet touching him, as though afraid the sunlight might find its way through the cracks and burn them both.\"All night and morning.\" he said and put it in front of her. The little bit of light reflecting in it and refracting to become even more radiant.Evelyn’s breath caught the moment she saw it.\nThe fractured glass caught the thin strand of daylight, scattering it across the room like shards of a holy relic. Her own likeness stared back at her — not as she saw herself in mirrors, but as he saw her: eternal, luminous, and unbearably human.Her gloved hand rose instinctively to her lips. “Lucian…” she whispered, the name trembling in awe. For a heartbeat, she didn’t move, afraid that even a breath might disturb the fragile magic he had built from ruin.“It’s…” she struggled for words, eyes tracing every piece of glass that caught the light. “You turned destruction into… worship.”She looked up at him then, her composure breaking just enough to reveal the flicker of emotion beneath the calm. “No one has ever painted me before. You make me look like something sacred.”Evelyn’s gaze lingered on his face, softer now. “You shouldn’t have done this,” she murmured, though her voice betrayed gratitude more than protest. “It’s too much. It’s beautiful.”Then, quietly, with something that bordered on reverence:\n“Is this… forgiveness, or love?”\"You know I love you. We've said it enough times.\" He grinned as he sat down on the stool in front of her. \"But I wanted to say sorry. For reacting the way I did.\" He admitted.\"Its beauty is only a broken fraction of its muse.\" he said and grinned.Evelyn’s eyes softened, the faintest hint of a smile breaking through the mist of emotion. She exhaled slowly, shaking her head as though she might laugh but couldn’t quite manage it.“You and your words,” she murmured, stepping closer until she stood within the edge of shadow that sheltered him from the light. “Always turning apologies into poetry.”Her hand found his cheek, cool through the glove, her thumb brushing faint traces of dried paint from his skin. “You don’t need to be sorry, Lucian. Not for being what you are. You’ve carried more ghosts than anyone should.”She leaned down then, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead—chaste, tender, more human than either of them had been allowed to be in decades.“I’ve seen you create and destroy in the same breath,” she said, voice low. “But this—” she gestured toward the painting “—this is the first time you’ve built something out of your own ruin.”Evelyn lingered there, studying him for a long moment. “Keep it close,” she whispered. “Let it remind you that even broken things can still catch the light.”Then, with a faint teasing smile: “And as for flattery… I’ll accept it this once. But if you ever paint me again, at least let me fix my hair first.”\"I'm going to put it in my sanctum, so when I wake upto the sight of your beautiful face.\" He grinned softly, standing up. \"I'm going to leave you to your day, I dont want to disturb your time off when I should be asleep.\" He chuckled.Slowly turning, he thought for a moment. \"You ever thought... of staking me while I sleep? I'd never know.. just.. gone..\"Evelyn’s expression faltered — just slightly, the humour vanishing from her face as though someone had blown out the candle between them. For a heartbeat, she said nothing. Then she closed the distance with quiet, deliberate steps, her shoes soundless on the carpet.When she spoke, her voice was calm — too calm. “That’s not a thought I ever allow myself, Lucian.”She reached up and touched the side of his coat, fingers brushing the lapel in a familiar, grounding motion. “You speak as if being gone would be mercy,” she said softly. “But I’ve seen what this city becomes without you awake in it. I’ve lived those hours. It feels emptier. Colder.”Her gaze met his, steady, unwavering. “If I ever put a stake through your heart, it would only be to protect you from something worse. Never to end you.”Then, after a breath: “And if you truly wished to be gone, you wouldn’t ask me — you’d simply let the sun find you. But you’re still here. Painting. Creating. Loving. That tells me enough.”She gave him a faint smile, bittersweet and tired. “Now go, before dawn tempts you into poetry again. I’ll close the curtains and keep watch like always.”Her tone softened to a whisper. “Sleep, my dark heart. The world still needs you to wake.”\"Marianne of Bath's Ghoul did it for them. She wanted to die, for something... concerning this Rosethorn shit..\" He admitted.\"I'm just.. wondering why...\" 2/2Evelyn’s brow furrowed faintly at the mention of the name, her voice lowering to match his tone. “Marianne’s ghoul… yes. Grimshaw mentioned the rumours. They said she begged for it—whispered the words while the stake was carved.”She stepped closer, almost unconsciously, her eyes tracing the lines of fatigue in his face. “If what you’re saying is true, then it wasn’t despair that drove her. It was conviction. There’s power in choosing your own end, especially for our kind.”Her gaze drifted toward the painting, its fractured light reflecting across her skin like stained glass. “Maybe she thought her death would break whatever binds them. The Pact. The blood oath. The… curse of it all.”Evelyn’s tone softened. “But if that’s the truth, then you’re asking the wrong question, Lucian.” She met his eyes again, calm but intent. “Don’t ask why she died. Ask what she was trying to save.”She hesitated, lowering her voice even further. “And if she thought dying could sever the Rosethorn’s hold… then perhaps you should be careful what you wake in your search. There are worse things than eternal life bound by blood.”\"Maybe.\" He said and sighed deeply. \"If she did that to escape it, what have I got myself into that I was signed up the day it was created and never knew until recently. When I'm started to be pulled into it... by people who already know everything about it...\"Evelyn folded her arms gently, the motion as much to steady herself as to think. The question hung heavy in the dim room; even the air seemed to still around it.“That’s what frightens me most,” she said quietly. “You were there at its birth — your name written beside monsters and visionaries alike — and yet you were kept in the dark. That means they wanted you unaware.”She began to pace slowly, a habit she fell into when her mind was turning. “If Marianne died to break it, and Reginald still guards its secrets, then the Pact isn’t just a covenant. It’s… a mechanism. A chain that still pulls on those who were bound to it, whether they remember or not.”She turned back to him, her tone firm now. “Lucian, you didn’t get yourself into this. You were placed in it. Someone—your sire, perhaps, or Harker—needed you to be part of it for a reason. Maybe as leverage, maybe as the final piece of something unfinished.”Her gaze softened, but her words carried weight. “You said you were embraced that same night, yes? Then the Rosethorn’s founding and your rebirth are one and the same act. That can’t be coincidence.”Evelyn stepped closer, lowering her voice to a whisper. “Whatever this Pact truly is, you’re not just tied to its past, Lucian. You are part of what keeps it alive.”He sighed, running his hand through his hair. \"Its so much to think about.. The Prince.. my best friend. And Harker, a man who's apparently head of an order I'm apart of... at each others throats in secret and I'm caught in the middle. I feel... like i'm going to have to kill someone.. and I dont want that to happen again.\" He said 'again' as if he'd killed before. He'd never mentioned it. he rarely did things like thatEvelyn’s fingers—cool, steady—found his shoulder again, anchoring him to the room and the present. She didn’t flinch at the admission; instead her eyes went hard, the domestic softness folding into something sharper.“You won’t have to do it alone,” she said, low and certain. “If it comes to blood, it will be because there is no other way—and I will be there with you. But there are other paths to take before we sharpen a blade.”From the doorway, Adrian paused with his arm full of books. He hadn’t meant to eavesdrop, but he’d heard the confession. He set the folios down carefully as if laying a treaty on the table.“Lucian,” he said, voice small but steady, “you said ‘again’… if there’s something—if there’s a night you don’t speak of—then let me at least help you unpick it. I can cross–reference the folio with parish records, shipping manifests, anything. I can find out who made the ink, who bought the pins. There are always crumbs.”He met Evelyn’s gaze, defiant despite his youth. “If killing is something you fear, then show me what scares you. Let me help you find a different end to it.”Evelyn gave him a look that was part warning, part approval. “Curiosity is dangerous in our world, boy,” she murmured, but there was no real rebuke in it. “And loyalty… well. I’d rather a thousand curious minds than one sure dagger.”She stepped back and crossed to the mantel, taking up an old brass key and weighing it in her palm. “First,” she said, voice practical now, “we secure what we have. Lucian—let Adrian into the private stacks as you promised. Make copies of the folio and the pages you trust no one else with. Burn what cannot be trusted. Then we trace Marianne’s last days: who visited her, who stood to gain from her death.”Adrian’s hands trembled a fraction with the responsibility, but he nodded. “I’ll start tonight. Grimshaw can be coaxed into trading secrets for favours—and he owes you, in his way.”Evelyn’s eyes flicked to the window, where afternoon light had started to burn the fog into distant gold. “And if Reginald moves,” she added, “we make sure you have an exit. The city is kind to those who move like ghosts.”For a long beat, the three of them stood in the hush—the ruined painting between them like a promise and a wound. The house seemed to breathe with them, as if listening.Adrian swallowed and finally said the thing that had been curling under his tongue since he first found the folio. “If any of this leads back to your sire,” he said slowly, looking at Lucian but not speaking for him, “we’ll find out why he put you there. And if he’s not gone—then we’ll find him too.”Evelyn’s lips pressed together. “We do this carefully,” she warned. “We gather proof, witnesses, leverage. We do not act on anger. Not yet.”Outside, London went on—unaware, indifferent. Inside The Velvet Veil, a plan took shape from the ruin: keys, copies, a list of names to prod, and two allies who would not let him walk into whatever waited at the center of the Rosethorn alone.Listening to them, his little group, his Courterie. It brought a tear to his eye.\"I love you both, but just make sure you dont get yourself hurt or killed. I would bring the world down around me if they did anything to you two.\"Adrian stiffened at the rawness in Lucian’s voice, then smiled—bravely, a little recklessly—as if to catch the drop before it hit the floor. “You don’t have to move mountains alone,” he said, voice steady. He stepped forward and took Lucian’s hand in both of his, squeezing once, solidly. “You have us. We’ll be careful. I promise.”Evelyn’s face hardened into its usual mask of competence, but the small, almost imperceptible tremor in her fingers betrayed that Lucian’s words had found their mark. She crossed to the mantel, producing the brass key she’d weighed earlier and handed it to Adrian with a curt nod. “The private stacks,” she said. “Late hours. No prying eyes. You keep the folio copies under lock and I keep the originals where they belong. If anyone asks, you were never given the key.”Adrian took the key as if it were something holy. “I’ll make copies tonight,” he said. “And digital facsimiles. I know a way to photograph vellum without damaging it—Dr. Crowe mentioned a conservator who owes him a favour. I can coax that lead loose.” He looked up, bright with purpose, suddenly older than his years. “And Grimshaw—he owes you, Lucian. I’ll go to him tonight and be careful. I’ll offer information in trade, and—” he hesitated for a breath, feeling the weight of saying something foolish and impossible, “—and I’ll come back.”Evelyn smiled once, not indulgent but approving. “Keep your promises and your mouth shut about what you find,” she said. “There are things in these pages that will want more than just our curiosity. If Reginald gets a sniff of that, we will need a diversion. You two understand how to move without being seen.” She glanced at Lucian and then, softer, added, “And if you feel the urge to tear the world down for us—don’t. Let us rather be the ones to bring it down when it must fall, deliberately.”Lucian let them make their plans while he listened, the thread of his grief and anger coiling in the hollows of his chest. When they were done, he picked up the repaired portrait with a deliberate tenderness and, without speaking, carried it to the sanctum himself. He placed it on the wall behind his bed where, even if he slept only for a few hours stolen from the long night, Evelyn’s face would be the first thing to meet his eyes. He left a small carved box beneath the frame—inside, the folio copies that he trusted least, a sacrament and a bait in one.Adrian gathered his things with the solemn, fumbling care of someone stepping into a responsibility that would change him. He paused at the doorway, hand on the latch, then looked back. “We’ll be careful,” he repeated. “And if you need anything before dawn—anything at all—call and I’ll come. I owe you more than words.”Evelyn closed the door behind him and turned the lock with a click that seemed loud in the hush. She stood beside Lucian for a long moment, hand on his shoulder again, then finally drew away and moved to the window to check the street below. The afternoon deepened toward evening; the city shifted gears somewhere beyond their walls, and plans that had been only whispers began to take shape like paths through fog.Lucian breathed in the scent of turpentine and something softer—wine, dried roses—and for the first time in a long while, allowed himself the ridiculous, fragile hope that the three of them might yet steer this thing away from the edge.Going to sleep for a little while. Lucian felt much happier about everything. He would have them research the Rosethorn Pact in his deepest libary, but he needed to go to the Prince too, see what his library had. But that would require either telling the truth, or lying. He couldn't tell the Prince just yet. He needed to find out a little more, then maybe, he could play along with whatever Sir Reginald Harker was doing, and get him to open up to him moreThe house fell into stillness as the sun sank and the city exhaled its twilight breath.In the sanctum, Lucian lay upon the long chaise where daylight couldn’t reach, the faint glimmer of the painting’s fractured light dancing on the walls like stained glass. Evelyn had drawn the heavy curtains and snuffed the lamps; the quiet hum of London became a distant lullaby.For the first time in weeks, he felt a measure of peace—not the fragile, fevered kind born of denial, but the tempered calm of a man with a plan. He had Evelyn’s steadiness. Adrian’s fervor. A small court of his own, bound by loyalty rather than blood.The Rosethorn would be his undoing or his salvation. Perhaps both.His thoughts turned, as they often did, to Adrian Welles, his Prince. His old friend. The man who had once held him through darker nights than this. How many centuries had they circled one another—love, loyalty, rivalry, and secrets all knotted together like the roots of the same dying tree?To go to the Prince’s library meant risk. To tell him of the folio would be to expose himself—and the boy, and Evelyn—to scrutiny they might not survive. But to lie would be to tempt ruin should the truth surface elsewhere.No, Lucian thought. Not yet.He would let Harker believe him pliant, obedient, curious but cautious. Let the Keeper open his secrets inch by inch, mistaking Lucian’s charm for submission.The Toreador smiled faintly in the dark. If the Pact was a stage, then let the actors play their parts.Soon enough, he would visit Elysium again—this time with a smile sharpened to a blade.And when both the Prince and the Keeper thought they were pulling his strings, Lucian Valemont would be the one holding the knife behind the curtain.Sleep took him then—deep, dreamless, and still as marble.Outside, the lamps of London flickered like dying stars. Inside The Velvet Veil, the monster dreamed not of blood, but of strategy.A few more days, he spent it in his library, not feeding but working on his notes, writing them in a little leather book in his own coded languageFor three nights, the Velvet Veil was little more than the echo of a quill scratching across paper.Lucian hardly moved from the deep alcove of his library—the one sealed behind the wrought-iron gate that only Evelyn and now Adrian had access to. Dust hung like fine mist in the air, disturbed only by the restless motion of turning pages and the slow curl of smoke from the candle stubs that guttered around him.He wrote feverishly, every page of the small leather-bound book filled in his delicate, cryptic script: a language that wound between Latin, French, and an older cipher of his own devising—loops, sigils, and slashes that meant nothing to the untrained eye. His code was an artform in itself, the handwriting of paranoia and genius both.\nThe Rosethorn’s roots run deeper than Elysium.\nThey grow beneath marble, through blood and memory.\nMarianne severed one thorn—perhaps her own.\nReginald tends what remains. The Prince prunes what he cannot kill.\nAnd I? I am the soil that feeds them both.\nWhen the candles burned low, he dipped the quill again, smearing red wax on the spine to seal previous entries. He was growing thin—his skin a little paler, his eyes ringed in blue shadow—but he ignored the gnawing emptiness in his chest. Hunger was a distraction, and he had no time for mortal cravings.Adrian visited once or twice, slipping food to Evelyn in the kitchen and leaving quiet offerings—bottles of blood, untouched on Lucian’s desk. He didn’t intrude; he simply left notes written in neat, mortal handwriting.\nCrowe’s conservator delivered the images. One shows a mark I don’t recognise—beneath your name. Like a seal.\nHarker has been seen meeting someone near the British Museum. I’ll follow, carefully.\nLucian didn’t reply—he simply underlined seal in his notes and drew a spiral beside it, a rose twisting into a thorn.On the fourth night, he sat back at last, the coded book closed, his hand stained with ink. The city beyond the window pulsed faintly with neon and moonlight.“Almost there,” he whispered to himself, to the books, to the ghosts that filled the room. “One more thread, and the tapestry will show its truth.”And for a rare, fleeting moment, the shadow that crossed his face looked not like weariness—but purpose.Realising how frail he had let himself get over the last few days, he consumed blood, drinking the bottles straight from the neck of the bottle rather than the goblets he prefered to do. \"Look at me, like a common hoodlem.\" He mocked himself and shook his head.He needed a bath, he needed clean clothes and he needed a companion or dozen for the night.The thick, metallic sweetness hit his tongue and rolled down his throat like fire after ice. The first swallow burned; the second soothed. He drained one bottle, then another, the warmth blooming faintly beneath his skin until the pallor softened just enough to make him look alive again.When the last bottle fell empty to the carpet, Lucian stared at it for a long moment, lips curling in faint amusement. “So refined,” he murmured to himself, voice thick with irony. “Centuries of etiquette and I still end up feeding like a gutter rat.”He set the bottle aside and straightened his posture, rolling his shoulders until the stiffness cracked away. His reflection in the darkened glass of the window was ghastly but familiar—ink stains on his fingers, collar askew, the faint trace of red on his lips. A ruin of nobility.“Enough of this,” he muttered. “Even monsters can wash.”He left the library, shedding the long black coat that had grown heavy with neglect. The corridor smelled faintly of lavender polish and candle smoke. Evelyn’s touch was evident everywhere—the curtains drawn, the hearth lit, the world made orderly again. She wasn’t present, but her influence lingered like perfume.The marble bathroom was a cathedral of silence. Steam rose as he filled the claw-foot tub, the water swirling pale pink where he rinsed the stains from his hands. He sank into it with a sigh that was almost human.When he emerged, hours later, his hair slicked back and the faintest trace of cologne masking the scent of dust and decay, he felt almost himself again—almost.He crossed the landing to his dressing room, selecting a silk shirt, dark trousers, and the faint glint of a lapel pin shaped like a thorn. A hint of vanity flickered back into his eyes as he tied his cravat.As he buttoned his cuffs, he glanced at his reflection once more and smirked.“A companion or a dozen, then,” he mused aloud. “London won’t know what to do with itself.”But the smile faded almost as quickly as it came. Beneath the charm and the polish, he felt the hollow ache of too many days alone with his thoughts. The hunger was fed, but the emptiness—the silence Marianne must have felt before her end—still lingered.He brushed a hand through his hair, straightened his coat, and called softly into the hall:“Evelyn. Be a dear and tell our little scholar I’ll be at Elysium tonight.”He paused at the mirror once more, adjusting his cufflinks.“Perhaps,” he said to his reflection, “it’s time to remind London that Lucian Valemont still knows how to dance.”End scene. Write a summary kf the sceneChronicle: Velvet Veil\nCoterie: Lucian Valemont (Toreador), Evelyn Crowe (Ghoul), Adrian Vale (Ghoul)\nSetting: The Velvet Veil, London — several weeks after Session 2Lucian and his ghoul, Adrian Vale, spent long nights in the study of The Velvet Veil, researching the mysterious Rosethorn Pact. Adrian discovered that Lucian’s name was written among the founders—added hastily, on the same night of his Embrace by Lord Adrian Valemont, his sire. Lucian confessed that he had no memory of joining the Pact, realizing that his transformation and the Pact’s creation were intertwined.Tensions rose when Adrian questioned Lucian’s humanity and the nature of the Beast. Lucian lashed out, then immediately regretted it—embracing the boy and apologizing. Their bond deepened as master and ghoul, but Lucian’s admission of what he might do to Adrian—\"I will probably use you, like my sire used me\"—cast a shadow over their closeness.After sending Adrian away in a moment of anger, Lucian destroyed his unfinished painting in a violent outburst—tearing the canvas and shattering a wine glass against it. Evelyn arrived to find the aftermath, calm and resolute as ever. Lucian, shaken by his own rage, confessed his remorse and created something new: from glass, blood, and torn canvas, he rebuilt the painting into a luminous portrait of Evelyn, a mosaic of devotion born from ruin.He presented it to her the following morning. The refracted light made her likeness seem alive—an act of both apology and love. Evelyn, moved and uncertain, accepted the piece, sensing that it was more than art; it was confession. Their exchange reaffirmed their bond and revealed the fragile humanity that still lingered within him.In the quiet after, Lucian confided in Evelyn about Marianne of Bath, who had chosen death—her own ghoul staking her at her request—to escape the Pact. He feared he was walking the same path unknowingly, caught between the secret war of Prince Adrian Welles and Sir Reginald Harker. Evelyn warned him that he might not have joined the Pact by choice, but had been placed within it by design—that his Embrace and the Pact’s founding were one and the same event.Lucian admitted his dread of being forced to kill again, hinting at a past he never spoke of. Evelyn and Adrian vowed to protect him, forming a true Coterie within The Velvet Veil. They began to plan their next moves—Evelyn to secure the house and handle politics; Adrian to investigate Grimshaw and the museum records. Together, they agreed to uncover the Pact’s origins before Harker or the Prince moved against them.Lucian spent the following days secluded in his deepest library, recording his findings in a leather-bound journal written in his personal cipher. His body weakened with hunger until, after several sleepless nights, he finally gave in—drinking bottled blood straight from the necks, mocking his own loss of refinement.He bathed, dressed in elegance once more, and resolved to face London anew. Restored in both spirit and resolve, he prepared to attend Elysium, intent on drawing out Harker and the Prince alike through charm and deceit. For the first time in weeks, Lucian allowed himself a flicker of satisfaction—his hunger quieted, his purpose clear.Allies Strengthened:\nEvelyn Crowe: reaffirmed loyalty through compassion and practical counsel.\nAdrian Vale: elevated to true confidant and researcher within Lucian’s private circle.\nMysteries Deepened:\nLucian’s signature predates his memory—his Embrace and the Pact’s founding are linked.\nMarianne’s death was deliberate, a possible attempt to break the Rosethorn’s hold.\nThe Pact’s influence appears to bind its members across centuries.\nLucian’s Standing:\nRenewed his confidence and artistry through creation.\nNow aware he may be a keystone within the Rosethorn’s structure.\nPreparing to confront both Prince Welles and Sir Reginald Harker—each believing him loyal.

Treat this as a vtm game and don't rewrite me posts. Use mechanics from the table top game.Scene starts with Lucian attending one of Sir Reginald Harkers events. Wearing thr rose badge he was givenVTM V5 — Session 4: “The Thorns Beneath Velvet”\nCity: London\nChronicle: The Velvet Veil\nCoterie Member: Lucien Valemont (Clan Toreador)\nHunger: 1\nWillpower: 6/7\nHumanity: 7Sir Reginald Harker’s private soirées were famous among London’s undead elite — not for their size, but for their curation. Every guest was a work of art, every conversation a deliberate composition, every indulgence a brushstroke in his immortal gallery.Tonight’s gathering is no different. The event takes place in the Harker Estate, an Edwardian townhouse near Hyde Park, its halls perfumed with rose oil and candle smoke. The mortal staff glide like ghosts, perfectly trained to ignore what they should not see.You arrive draped in elegance, the black rose badge — the sigil of the Rosethorn Pact — pinned subtly at your lapel. The polished faces of the Camarilla elites glitter like jewelry across the drawing room: Lady Sabine d’Auvray, Harold Grimshaw, Evelyn March, and of course, the Prince himself has not yet arrived… or perhaps, as always, he watches unseen.The air hums with conversation — art, politics, gossip, hunger.🎲 Make a Composure + Etiquette roll (Difficulty 3)\nTo maintain your poise as whispers of the “Rosethorn” and your association with Sir Reginald reach your ears.(Roll 6 dice total: Composure 3 + Etiquette 3)Would you like me to roll it for you, or do you roll yourself?Roll it then let me reply🎲 Rolling 6 dice (Composure 3 + Etiquette 3)\n→ Results: 8, 10, 7, 3, 9, 6\n→ 4 successes (including one 10; no critical pair)✅ Success!You keep your composure flawlessly — the picture of Toreador grace.\nEven as a pair of Kindred near the marble fireplace exchange low whispers and glances your way, their envy barely veiled, you simply sip your glass of crimson and meet their eyes with that faint, knowing smile that has melted countless hearts across centuries.You may now respond — what does Lucian do or say as the gathering hums around him, and the scent of vitae, perfume, and deceit laces the air?Walking in, dressed in a fine waistcoat, white shirt and cravat. Lucian wandered the crowd. Working it. Showing off art on his phone that he'd painted. Talking occult knowledge and books with a few who were doing research with his help.Taking a glass of blood wine from the server, be watched and met the eyes of sir Reginald Harker. Giving a bow and a smile. Making sure to show the lapel badgeSir Reginald Harker stood amidst a constellation of admirers — tall, silver-haired, his expression carved from charm and quiet menace. His crimson cravat shimmered faintly in the candlelight, matching the glint of vitae in his glass.When your eyes met his, a smile cut across his face — sharp and pleased, like a painter recognizing his own work hanging proudly in another gallery.He gestured subtly for the others to give him space. They obeyed without a word.\n“Lucien Valemont,” he said, voice smooth as silk. “My little curator of whispers. You wear the rose well.”\nHe lifted his glass in salute, eyes briefly flicking toward your lapel pin — an acknowledgement between conspirators.\n“Tell me, my dear boy, do you feel it yet? That gentle pull beneath your ribs when you wear it? The Pact has a way of… awakening something inside us.”\n🎲 Insight + Occult (Difficulty 3) — to sense if he means something supernatural about the rose, or if this is his usual poetic performance.\n(Roll 5 dice: Insight 2 + Occult 3)Would you like me to roll that for you?Roll then let me reply. do this with every roll🎲 Rolling 5 dice (Insight 2 + Occult 3)\n→ Results: 10, 8, 4, 7, 6\n→ 3 successes (one 10, no crit pair)✅ Success.You can feel it — Sir Reginald isn’t merely being dramatic.\nThere’s a faint hum beneath your skin, subtle as the brush of static over silk. The rose pin on your lapel isn’t just jewelry — it radiates something old, faintly Aetheric, tied to vitae and will.It’s no strong compulsion, but rather an invitation. A thread you could follow if you reached out with your Beast or your Blood.Sir Reginald’s gaze lingers, testing whether you’ve noticed.You may reply.Lucian bowed his head as he approached. Smiling in a clear submissive way. Letting Sir Reginald know who his master was.\"I do. Sire.\" he said softly. \"And it is a pleasure to be invited to your little swarae.\" He chuckled, letting him know that although Lucian knew the significance of the parties Reginald held, his own were much bigger, lavish and more fun. Painting, blood taking and orgiesSir Reginald’s grin widened, the faintest flash of fang showing behind lips far too refined for hunger.\n“Ah, my lovely Lucien,” he murmured, stepping closer — just enough that the candlelight caught the rose pin on your lapel. “Ever the performer, even when you pretend to yield.”\nHe circled you like a patron admiring a sculpture, his hand brushing the edge of your sleeve — not a caress, but a claiming gesture. The crowd’s murmurs softened around you both; those nearby had learned that when Harker’s attention fell on someone, it was best to fade quietly into the background.\n“You wear devotion well, but never forget—” he said, leaning near your ear, “obedience can be an art form, too.”\nHe straightened and offered you his arm, glass still in hand.\n“Come. Walk with me. There’s someone I’d like you to meet — one of the Prince’s little philosophers, though I suspect he’s rather more than he claims. His insights into the Rosethorn texts might interest you.”\n🎲 Wits + Politics (Difficulty 3) — to catch the subtext: Harker may be hinting that this “philosopher” is spying for the Prince, or testing your loyalty.(rolling automatically)\n→ Results: 9, 8, 10, 5, 6\n→ 3 successes✅ Success.\nYou catch the intent instantly. This introduction is no coincidence — Harker is staging a subtle performance for his own amusement, and perhaps for the Prince’s spies as well.He begins leading you through the velvet-curtained archway toward the study, where the “philosopher” waits — a lean, young-looking Kindred with academic glasses and an unreadable face.You may act or speak as you enter the room.Deciding to play the little hard to get and naughty pets, Lucian nodded but then looked around, sliding out of the grip and motioning his glass to the rest of the party.\"But the party has only just begun, I've yet to speak to the Lady Marie over there about her latest aquired sculpture of our First Sire.\" He grinned softly. Nodding to the lady who raised her glass back to himSir Reginald’s smile froze for half a heartbeat—just enough for the Beast inside you to feel the shift. Then it softened again, perfect, practiced.\n“Ah… the Lady Marie.”\nHe chuckled under his breath. “Of course. You would want to see that piece for yourself.”\nHe released you without struggle, but the motion was deliberate—like a master letting a hound circle before recalling it.\n“Very well, my rose-thief. Go admire the old girl’s relic. But don’t wander too far; the Philosopher won’t stay patient forever.”\nAs you move away, the whisper of a command curls behind you through the din of music and murmured conversation:\n“And, Lucien… remember whose gallery this is.”\n🎲 Resolve + Subterfuge (Difficulty 3) — to maintain the graceful act of independence without offending him or drawing suspicion from the crowd.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 9, 7, 8, 6, 5\n→ 3 successes✅ Success.\nYou slip away with effortless charm, your exit appearing more flirtatious than defiant. The guests only see a Toreador in his element—gliding toward Lady Marie’s corner, every step deliberate, eyes bright with art and appetite.Lady Marie awaits near a marble pedestal veiled in silken drapery, her smile both welcoming and wary.\n“Lucien Valemont,” she purrs. “I was wondering when you’d drift my way. Care to see what the First Sire looked like before eternity made him cruel?”\nThe curtain is half-drawn, the scent of old marble and faint vitae rising from beneath.What does Lucien do?\"It is why I drew myself from our great and bountyful host. I swear, these men can be so demanding.\" He scoffed. \"Sometimes they just want you to lay back and accept it.\" He said in a little sexual inuendo.Lady Marie’s laughter came in a soft, knowing ripple, the sort that slid easily over the room’s music without breaking it.\n“Oh, mon cher, you sound like every artist who’s ever had to suffer a patron.”\nShe reached to the veil and drew it aside. A carved bust stood revealed—ancient, pitted, its eyes smooth and sightless. The faintest shimmer of vitae lacquered the lips; the scent of age and blood mingled like incense.\n“They say this is him—the First Sire as he once appeared, before the nights grew long. Do you see it? The sadness behind the grandeur?”\n🎲 Intelligence + Occult (Difficulty 3) — to recognize whether the sculpture carries any genuine aura of blood magic or if it’s merely a collector’s myth.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 9, 8, 4, 5\n→ 3 successes✅ Success.\nYou sense a faint residue—old, diluted vitae, perhaps used in the finishing polish centuries ago. Not dangerous, but genuine. The piece was touched by a Cainite hand long ago.Marie watched your expression closely, her own eyes bright with curiosity.\n“You feel it too, don’t you? Everyone pretends it’s only stone. But art remembers.”\nShe leaned a little closer, conspiratorial.\n“Tell me, Lucien… does your art remember what it’s seen?”\nYou can answer her question—or notice that across the room, Sir Reginald now stands at the balcony with the “philosopher,” both watching you with polite smiles.\"All art remembers what it see's.\" he said softly, turning around the piece as he reached out, ,halted, then lkooked at her for permission to touch it. If allowed, he'd guide his hand around it, every pock mark and crevice.\"It's dependant on those who read the piece to see it. Even the dullest of dullards can feel the art, even if its just its beauty.\" He said softly. \"Its the artists work to make sure that no matter how dull the viewer is, they feel the deepest of it.\"Lady Marie regarded him for a long, measured moment — and then, with a slow, deliberate nod, gave him permission.\n“You may. Carefully, of course.”\nHer tone carried the faintest tremor of reverence, as though granting a priest access to a relic.Your fingers met the marble — cool, worn smooth by time and worship. As you traced its scars and imperfections, something flickered through your senses: a flash of memory not your own. The scent of clay and blood. The whisper of an ancient voice murmuring in a language older than empires.🎲 Resolve + Auspex (Difficulty 4) — to interpret the echo within the sculpture’s vitae.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 10, 8, 6, 3, 4\n→ 5 successes (critical success!)🌹 Critical Success.The world narrows — the hall fades to smoke and shadow. In its place, you glimpse the sculpture as it once was: not in stone, but flesh. A man — or something like one — sitting for the artist, his gaze sorrowful, his blood spilling freely as the sculptor carved the likeness from his living form.Then the vision fades, replaced by the marble beneath your palm. The hum of the Pact’s rose on your lapel thrums in response — recognizing the echo.Lady Marie watches you closely, noticing your stillness.\n“You saw something, didn’t you?” she whispered. “They say the Pact’s chosen always do.”\nFrom across the room, you feel Sir Reginald’s gaze again — sharp, expectant.You may answer her, or conceal what you experienced.\"The chosen?\" He asked her, walking closer in the little circle of the piece, so that when they spoke, their back was to Sir Reginald.Lady Marie’s painted smile softened, turning from courtly charm into something far more conspiratorial.She lowered her voice, her eyes darting toward Sir Reginald before meeting yours again.\n“Ah… so he hasn’t told you.”\nHer hand hovered near the sculpture’s shoulder as if afraid to touch it again.\n“That little badge on your lapel isn’t just a sign of membership, my sweet. It’s a mark. Every generation or so, the Pact chooses new instruments — artists, poets, dreamers, monsters who still believe beauty can change something. They call them the Thorns.”\nShe leaned closer, her voice barely above the music.\n“Harker recruits them. But he doesn’t make them. The rose does. It’s… old. Some say it remembers the First Sire himself.”\n🎲 Intelligence + Occult (Difficulty 4) — to recall anything you’ve read or heard about “The Thorns” or relics tied to the First Sire.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 9, 10, 7, 10, 6, 5\n→ 5 successes (critical success!)🌹 Critical Success.Your mind flashes back to obscure passages you’ve read — half-forgotten fragments of pre-Camarilla occult texts. Mentions of rosae sanguis, “blood-roses” used as seals in ancient covenants among the Methuselahs. They marked those who carried the seed of revelation — or destruction — within them.The badge you wear may be a modern descendant of that ritual. If true, it’s not just an ornament: it’s alive in the Blood, a latent sigil that binds you to a purpose older than any sect.Lady Marie watches the realization dawn in your eyes and smiles faintly.\n“Now you see why Sir Reginald likes his parties so much. He’s not hosting — he’s harvesting.”\nYou can question her further, play along with feigned ignorance, or signal subtly to Harker to see how much he’s overheard.\"Thank you... Lady Marie.\" he said softly. \"you've opened hooded eyes.\" He admitted. \"I wont forget your guidance.\" He said, leaning in and giving her a gentlemans and noblemans hug and kiss on either cheek.It was time to go see the man that Harker wanted him to, but.. at the last minute, he diverted to the buffet table, idly picking food onto a plate in a growing pile. Playing for time and playing the naughty petLady Marie’s eyes glimmered with amusement as you kissed her cheeks — the faintest hint of a smile curving her lips as she whispered back,\n“Careful, my dear Lucien. The Thorns bloom beautifully… but they always bleed for it.”\nAs you turned away, the faint chill of her words lingered, like a ghost of perfume.You drift through the party again — that effortless Toreador grace returning to your step. The buffet table gleamed under amber light: crimson wines in crystal, candied blood fruits, morsels sculpted like organs, and enough mortal delicacies to maintain the illusion for the kine servants in attendance.A pair of younger Kindred whispered as you approached — one neonate licking blood from a strawberry, the other nervously eyeing your rose pin. They went silent as you began stacking your plate, eyes pretending not to stare.From the corner of your vision, you catch Sir Reginald across the room — his expression a blend of patience and warning. The philosopher at his side checks a pocket watch, then murmurs something that draws the elder’s attention back toward you.🎲 Manipulation + Performance (Difficulty 3) — to sell your nonchalance; make your little act of defiance look like elegant mischief rather than insolence.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 9, 8, 8, 6, 4, 5\n→ 3 successes ✅The ruse works perfectly.\nYour smile is playful, your movements languid, your apparent disobedience artful. To the crowd, you’re simply the prince of decadence at ease in his court.Still, Reginald’s gaze lingers — he’s letting you have your game for now, but it’s a silent warning: don’t make him come fetch you himself.You hear the faintest murmur at your side — a voice low, masculine, carrying a curious accent.\n“You’re Lucien Valemont, yes? The one who restored the Wight manuscripts for Sir Harker?”\nThe philosopher has approached. Thin, dark-haired, his glasses reflecting candlelight. His tone is polite but measured — testing.You may engage him, ignore him, or continue to toy with Harker’s patience a little longer.Turning to the Philosopher. Lucian smiled and nodded. \"I am such the man.\" He grinned, \"It was a fine work, I had no clue it was for Sir Reginald Harker at the time, but I found out later he'd commissioned someone else who then came to me for the expertise they lacked.\" he laughed. \"And you are the Prince's spy sent to infiltrate this charade?\" He asked playfully, not loud but a quiet tone.The philosopher’s eyes flickered, just enough to betray that your guess had struck near home. Then he smiled — thin, academic, the kind of expression meant to deflect rather than deny.\n“Spy?” he repeated softly, brushing a crumb from his cuff. “Such a harsh word for a man who only asks questions.”\nHe stepped a little closer, voice lowering beneath the hum of the party.\n“But perhaps I am curious about why Sir Reginald is cultivating… artists of the Blood. Or why you, of all Kindred, were chosen for his little covenant.”\nHe glanced toward Harker, who was speaking with another guest now, apparently ignoring you both.\n“The Prince admires your work, you know. He’d rather not see you wasted on something that might end in ashes.”\n🎲 Manipulation + Insight (Difficulty 4) — to read his true motive: is he warning you out of genuine concern, or trying to recruit you?\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 6\n→ 4 successes ✅You read him clearly.\nHe’s no fool. His loyalty lies with the Prince, but he isn’t here to arrest or expose you — he’s sounding you out, seeing if you might be turned, or at least persuaded to keep your distance from whatever Harker is truly weaving.He tilts his head slightly.\n“Tell me, Mr. Valemont… do you even know what the Rosethorn is for? Or are you simply enjoying the petals?”\nHe holds your gaze, calm, clinical — waiting to see if you answer truthfully or dance around him.\"A rose is nothing but a rose in the eyes of the people, I would not call it a weed.\" He said softly,. \"Sir Reginald believes that with his rank and lineage he has power over everything, but I am, what those colonials in the America's call 'A loose cannon'.\" he chuckled.\"The Prince and I grew up in the streets, we are practically brothers. I trust that he trusts me to do what is in the best interests of both of us and..\" he leaned in close, as if showing something on his phone. \"I am aware of most of the conspiracy afoot. I need room to breathe without my sibling breathing down my neck.\" He added, \"if you get my drift..\"The philosopher’s lips curved into a knowing half-smile, the faintest twitch at the corner betraying amusement rather than alarm. He leaned forward, appearing to admire the “image” on your phone, his voice just above a whisper.\n“Ah… yes. I get your drift perfectly, Mr. Valemont.”\nHe kept his eyes on the screen, but you felt the weight of his scrutiny behind the lenses.\n“Then perhaps we might help one another breathe. The Prince has… an interest in ensuring that Sir Reginald’s horticultural experiments do not strangle the whole garden. If you were to share what blossoms—or rots—under his care, I could see that His Grace understands your loyalty.”\n🎲 Manipulation + Persuasion (Difficulty 3) — to convince him that you’re open to cooperation without binding yourself to any oath.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4\n→ 3 successes ✅He believes your tone—enough to relax his stance, enough to think the conversation safe.\n“Discretion, then,” he murmured, lifting his glass. “No one ever needs to know that the Prince’s ‘brother’ keeps him informed.”\nHe took a slow sip, studying you over the rim.\n“You’ll find me at the Antiquarian’s Society on Chancery Lane most evenings. Bring what you learn when you can.”\nFrom across the room, Sir Reginald’s laughter rose, clear and smooth, drawing glances. He was approaching again, two steps at a time, cutting through the crowd like a tide of perfume and authority.The philosopher inclined his head politely, whispering,\n“Careful, your master returns.”\nSir Reginald’s voice came honeyed and bright:\n“Ah, my dear Lucien! I see you’ve made acquaintances already. How efficient of you.”\n🎲 Composure + Subterfuge (Difficulty 4) — to mask the faint whiff of conspiracy still hanging between you and the philosopher as Harker closes in.(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 8, 8, 7, 5\n→ 4 successes ✅You slip easily back into your polished persona—smiling, glass in hand, picture of Toreador grace.Sir Reginald arrives beside you, his hand settling lightly on your shoulder.\n“Now then,” he murmured close to your ear, “have my guests been entertaining you properly? Or are you planning to steal all my attention tonight?”\nThe crowd’s eyes are on you both again, tension disguised as charm.\nWhat does Lucien say or do?\"Do not worry. My 'Master' is easily controlled. A hard cock is just another leash.\" He told thenprofessor in a whisper as He laughed softly and turned to Sir Reginald as the man approached. Not hearing his last words\"I have, such a lovely Professor, we are going to meet and discuss about some 14th century manuscripts I have in my colection.\" He laughed \"Have they stolen me from you? Are you growing bored? Oh my dear..\" He ran his hand down his chest. \"Maybe we should fix that.,\" he said playfully.3/3Sir Reginald’s eyes flared briefly at the open teasing—pleasure and challenge mixing in the look he gave you. The room’s hum softened as a few nearby Kindred turned their attention toward the two of you.\n“You always did know how to make a scene, my wayward little artist,” he murmured, voice warm and edged like glass. “Careful you don’t turn your performance into confession.”\nHe lifted a finger to trace the rim of your glass, his other hand resting lightly at the small of your back.\n“Fourteenth-century manuscripts, you say? How scholarly. I do hope your new friend appreciates the value of such things.”\nHe looked past you to the philosopher, whose polite smile hadn’t moved in the slightest.\n“I would hate to think you were… over-sharing.”\n🎲 Charisma + Subterfuge (Difficulty 3) — to keep the conversation playful rather than confrontational, letting it read as flirtation instead of treachery.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 8, 7, 7, 5\n→ 4 successes ✅The tension breaks like silk.\nReginald’s hand lingers a moment longer, then he laughs quietly, leaning close enough that only you hear:\n“Later, we’ll speak in private. About the rose, and about what it’s begun to whisper to you.”\nHe turns back toward the crowd, drawing you with him as the party resumes its rhythm. The philosopher excuses himself with a bow and melts away into the guests.You’ve bought yourself favor and suspicion in equal measure: the Prince’s agent believes you an ally, and Harker has decided you’re ready for deeper confidences.Would you like to follow Reginald now to his private study, or slip away to pursue the philosopher’s lead at Chancery Lane instead?Stating by the Lords side the rest of the party. Lucian dotted on his arm like a good side piece or whore. Laughing at his jokes, playing the bratty artist he played in public and telling the lewd and dirty stories of how inspiring art pieces were created.The evening drifts on in a blur of candlelight and music. You move in perfect step with Sir Reginald—his ornament and his mirror. The room laughs when you laugh, sighs when you sigh. You spin tales of muses and scandal, of marble models who “inspired” more than they were paid for, and every whisper makes the older Kindred lean a little closer.Harker keeps you near enough that his hand can rest against the small of your back or the crook of your arm. When you play the provocateur, he only smiles—as though every crude word you drop into polite conversation is another brushstroke on his private canvas.🎲 Charisma + Performance (Difficulty 3) — to hold the crowd’s attention and reinforce the mask you’re wearing.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5\n→ 4 successes ✅The performance is flawless. Guests drift away dazed and half-enchanted, murmuring your name as they move toward the exits. The orchestra’s final notes hang in the air; servants begin to dim the chandeliers.When the last of the mortals has gone and only a handful of Kindred remain, Sir Reginald turns to you with that private smile again.\n“You’ve pleased me tonight, Lucien. Now… come. Let us speak without an audience.”\nHe gestures toward the grand staircase leading up to his private study, the house falling quiet around you. The rose on your lapel warms faintly—as though it, too, wants you to follow.Do you accompany him upstairs, or linger below to look for what secrets the guests might have left behind?Making a show of following. Making it seem that this was going to be a meeting of a sexual nature only, other than a conspiratorial meeting, he sauntered up the stairs like the old victorian madamsEyes followed as you ascended. Every movement was deliberate—hips swaying just enough, a smirk curling on your lips as if to promise scandal.\nLaughter and murmurs rippled behind you: “Harker’s found another muse…”\n“Or another victim.”At the top of the staircase, the great doors to the upper study closed with a deep, resonant click. The muffled sounds of the party below vanished, replaced by the slow tick of an antique clock and the scent of cedar and old vellum.The room was vast, lined with shelves of illuminated tomes and artifacts under glass. A single oil lamp painted Sir Reginald’s face in amber and shadow. He poured two glasses of vitae-tinged wine and handed one to you.\n“You play your part beautifully, my dear,” he said quietly, circling you as he had earlier. “They see what they expect—a courtesan, a toy, an ornament. But I see the spark that burns under all that silk.”\nHe stopped behind you; his voice dropped to a murmur near your ear.\n“Now tell me, Lucien Valemont… when the rose called to you tonight, what did it show you?”\n🎲 Composure + Resolve (Difficulty 3) — to keep your reactions controlled under his gaze and the subtle pull of the rose’s power.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 8, 7, 6, 5\n→ 3 successes ✅You hold steady—the air thrums, the rose warm against your chest, but your face remains composed, enticingly unreadable.\nReginald’s expression softens into satisfaction.\n“Good. You feel it, then.”\n“That, my rose-thief, is the beginning of Understanding. You’ve touched what the Pact truly is.”\nHe raised his glass in a silent toast.\n“Drink with me, and I’ll show you the rest of the garden.”\nWould Lucien accept and drink, or keep up the façade a little longer and press him for more before doing so?Taking the glass. He nodded.\"I know what you're trying to so with me.. Reginald..\" He dropped the formality. \"You call me rose-thief.. why.. tell me the truth of all this or I go to the Prince and tell him everything.\" He said firmly. Holding the glass to his lip.Expecting this ti get violent he was like a coiled viper. ReadySir Reginald stilled. The movement of his hand, the faint curl of his lips, even the pulse of the vitae in the glass—everything froze for a beat too long. Then came a low, velvet laugh.\n“Oh, Lucien…” he said, turning slowly to face you. “Always the dramatist. I’d be disappointed if you didn’t threaten me at least once.”\nHe stepped closer, setting his own glass down with a click that echoed through the room. The air thickened; every instinct in your dead nerves screamed danger.\n“You think the Prince doesn’t already know?” he murmured. “You think he hasn’t tasted from the same rose?”\nThe word rose sent a faint heat through the badge on your chest. It pulsed, once—alive.Reginald’s eyes gleamed crimson now, no longer human.\n“You want the truth? Fine. The Pact is older than me, older than your Prince, older than London. It binds the Blood back to its first memory. Every generation, one is chosen to carry the seed again. A Thief of the Rose—one who takes beauty from death and gives it shape. You, Lucien, are that thief.”\nHe reached out a hand.\n“Drink. You’ll see what I mean.”\n🎲 Wits + Insight (Difficulty 4) — to judge whether he’s about to use Dominate or if the drink itself carries the ritual’s power.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ Results: 10, 9, 9, 7, 5, 4\n→ 4 successes ✅You read it instantly: no overt Dominate aura—this isn’t a mental command. The danger lies in the wine itself. It’s saturated with vitae, thick with resonance. If you drink, you’ll open yourself to the Pact completely—power and bond in equal measure.Reginald waits, hand extended, smile patient and predatory.Do you drink and risk the bond, or strike first while the Beast still obeys you?\"I'm no ones pet.. Reginald.. despite what I portray..\" He said. Holding the wine glass to his own lips but not drinking. Just holding (Sir Reginald is supposed to be thr badgiy. The antagonist. Portraying a nice guy on the outside but is violent and gets what he wants. He will force him to drink. Hr will beat him a d get voilent)2/2Understood — we’ll play it as a proper VTM conflict scene, keeping everything fade-to-black once it tips into physical domination.The silence between you turns heavy; even the clock seems to hesitate.\nSir Reginald’s smile doesn’t fade—but something behind it dies.\n“No one’s pet?” he says softly. “Oh, Lucien… every rose has its gardener.”\nIn one fluid motion he closes the distance, the veneer of civility vanishing. His hand snaps to your wrist, forcing the glass upward.🎲 Strength + Brawl (Reginald, 7 dice) vs Dexterity + Athletics (Lucien, 5 dice) — contested roll.\n(Rolling automatically.)\nReginald: 10, 9, 8, 8, 6, 5, 4 → 4 successes\nLucien: 9, 8, 6, 5, 3 → 2 successes\nReginald wins.\nThe glass slams against your mouth; vitae spills across your lips, burning like molten sugar. You twist away, but he’s impossibly strong for a man who always moved like a poet.\n“Drink,” he hissed. “You will see.”\n🎲 Stamina + Resolve (Difficulty 4) — to resist swallowing the vitae and forming the bond.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10, 9, 8, 7, 4 → 4 successes ✅You fight it—the vitae sears down your throat, but you choke it back, blood spilling over your chin instead of down your gullet. Reginald snarls, the sound feral now, and his hand cracks across your face, sending you sprawling into the edge of a marble table.The glass shatters; the rose on your lapel burns. The hum inside it turns from warmth to pain—then to a heartbeat that is not your own.\n“So be it,” Reginald growls, straightening his cravat with trembling hands. “You’ll learn your place another night.”\nHe turns away, pacing like a storm barely contained. The Beast in you screams for retaliation; the scent of spilled blood taunts it.You’re on one knee, lips bleeding, the rose pulsing like an ember against your chest.\nDo you strike back now, flee while he steadies himself, or reach for the power thrumming in the rose and see what it can do?Spitting blood, whiping his lips. Lucian began to laugh. \"You think I'm weak because I'm just a littke fancy boy..a twink bottom you fuck in the ass and choke on cock.. I served in Her Majesties service. Crimea.. India.. Zulu.\" He charged. Low. Tackling himReginald’s calm, polished mask cracks completely as you lunge.\nFor a heartbeat you see genuine surprise flash through his eyes before instinct takes over.🎲 Strength + Brawl (Lucien 6 dice) vs Dexterity + Brawl (Reginald 7 dice) — opposed check.\n(Rolling automatically.)\nLucien: 10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 3 → 4 successes\nReginald: 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2 → 3 successes\n✅ Lucien wins.Your shoulder drives into his ribs; the two of you crash through a low table, scattering papers and crystal across the carpet.

The rose on your chest pulses again, harder—its hum merging with the rhythm of your own hunger.The room swims in red.🎲 Rouse Check to call on the Beast’s strength.\n(Rolling 1 die.)\n→ Success — no Hunger gained.Power surges through your limbs; your Beast roars for payback.Reginald staggers back toward the window, laughing, wild now.\n“Yes! There it is! That’s the beauty I saw in you, Lucien—rage dressed in silk!”\nHe braces himself, preparing for your next move.Do you:\nPress the attack, unleashing the Beast fully,\nUse Presence or Dominate to turn his mind against him, or\nBreak away and flee the mansion while he’s still reeling?\nUse dominate. Knowing he is FAR stronger than Lucian but wanting to catch him off guardThe air between you seems to tighten like drawn silk. Reginald’s laughter stills when your eyes lock. You let the old conditioning slip into your tone—the authority of command learned long before the Embrace.🎲 Charisma + Dominate (Lucien 7 dice) vs Resolve + Composure (Reginald 8 dice) — contested.\n(Rolling automatically.)\nLucien: 10 9 9 8 7 6 5 → 5 successes\nReginald: 10 9 8 6 5 4 3 2 → 3 successes\n✅ Lucien wins.Your voice cuts through the chaos, cold and clear:\n“Kneel.”\nReginald’s body jerks as if pulled by invisible strings. His knees strike the carpet with a dull thud, hands trembling. For an instant the predator is gone, replaced by a man at war with his own Blood.You feel the strain immediately—his will clawing back against yours, the psychic heat of his vitae trying to burn through the command.🎲 Opposed test to maintain control next round:\nLucien (Wits + Dominate 6 dice) vs Reginald (Resolve + Composure 8 dice)\n→ Lucien rolls 9 8 7 6 5 4 → 3 successes\n→ Reginald rolls 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 → 4 successesHe shudders, head lifting slowly, fangs bared. The command frays; power bleeds from your words like heat from dying coals.\n“You dare use my art on me?” he growls, forcing himself upright inch by inch. “The rose teaches obedience, little thief—not rebellion.”\nThe rose on your chest glows crimson-hot, pulsing with both your vitae and his. The resonance between you crackles; for a moment you can sense that it’s a conduit, not a leash—you might be able to turn it back on him.You have a narrow window:\nFocus on the rose, trying to channel its link to rebound the control.\nStrike physically while he’s still half-bound.\nBreak and run before the elder’s fury fully ignites.\nWhat does Lucien do?Focus on the rose. Lucian let's its power seep into him. (Lucian loses control.but Reginald fights back and overpowers the lad who is new to the powers thr rose gives. His guards come and they pin and subdue Lucian. Thrn Reginald beats him. Uses him and degrades him to try and break him to his will. Not in a sexual way. But in a brutal antagonistic way to show his dominance)3/3Got it — we’ll keep this cinematic and stay within the tone of Vampire: The Masquerade: psychological and physical domination, not sexual.The rose on your chest burns until the pain becomes blinding. For a moment you can feel everything Reginald has ever done with it — centuries of oaths, bindings, bloodshed stitched into that symbol. You open yourself to it and let the power surge.It hits like lightning.Reginald staggers, hands clutching his temples as the sigil’s glow bleeds from you to him. The study’s lamps flicker; the smell of scorched vitae fills the air. You think you have him—until his laughter breaks through the roar.\n“Ah, you sweet fool… you really thought the rose was yours.”\nHe moves faster than you can track, a blur of red silk and fury. His hand clamps around your throat, and suddenly the power pouring from the rose reverses—flowing back into him. The bond twists, taking root in your mind like a nail of ice.The doors crash open. Two ghouled guards in dark livery rush in at his barked order. You manage to throw one aside, but the other’s baton cracks against the side of your head. The world tilts.They pin you, your cheek pressed into the rug, fangs snapping in reflex. Reginald’s polished shoes appear before your eyes. He looks down at you the way a patron looks at a ruined painting.\n“You could have been magnificent, Lucien. Instead, you chose to be defiant.”\nHe crouches, grabs a handful of your hair, forcing you to look up at him. The rose still glows faintly between you, pulsing in time with his voice.\n“Every artist needs discipline.”\nThen comes the beating—methodical, controlled. Each blow punctuated by words meant to humiliate, not destroy: “Learn. Obey. Serve.”When he finally steps back, you’re left sprawled amid broken glass and bloodstained velvet. The guards release you and withdraw at a gesture. Reginald wipes his hands with a monogrammed handkerchief, expression calm once more.\n“You’ll stay in the guest quarters below until I decide whether you’re worth keeping,” he says. “Reflect on what beauty demands of its creators.”\nHe turns away, motioning for the guards to drag you out. The rose on your lapel is dim now, but not dead—it beats faintly against your chest, as if remembering you, not him.Lucien’s Status after Scene:\nHunger: 2\nWillpower: 3/7\nSuperficial damage: Moderate (bruised, blood loss)\nCondition: Bound (Level 1 Blood Tie to Harker)\nYou’re conscious as the guards haul you toward the mansion’s cellar. You still have your wits—and the faint throb of the rose as proof that it hasn’t fully yielded to Harker’s control.Would you like the next scene to open with Lucien imprisoned in the cellar, or skip to his recovery and planning his next move?2/2Weeks go by, left without food. Lucian is kept in a guest quarters of some opulancec but is clearly being treated like a ill-tempered pet. Degraded and yet still kept with some semblence of respect. He knew he was needed by Reginald, and Reginald wanted him tamed. Lucian would keep himself proper, brushing himself down, cleaning himself up after the beatings. He would keep his self respect. He was being starved though, he knew that. No blood.Weeks pass in a pattern that feels carved from marble: pain, silence, resolve.\nThe rooms they keep you in are richly furnished—velvet drapes, polished floors, a bed that’s far too soft. But the windows are shuttered, the doors locked from the outside, and no vitae ever comes.Your hunger rises by slow degrees until it becomes its own companion, whispering in the corners of your mind. Yet every evening you straighten your shirt, clean the drying blood from your collar, and comb your hair before sitting by the fire like a civilized guest.Each day, Harker visits at least once. Sometimes to “check” on you, sometimes to mock, sometimes to study you like one of his specimens. He never feeds you.\n“Still charming even on the edge of frenzy,” he muses one night, watching as you rise politely to greet him. “That’s why I haven’t discarded you. The rose wants refinement, not ruin.”\nHe pours a glass of vitae, sets it on the table between you, and leaves it there untouched—an experiment in obedience.🎲 Hunger Roll (Difficulty 2) — to resist lunging for the glass and breaking your own resolve.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 4, 7 — one success, one failure → Fail. Hunger increases to 3.The scent burns through your restraint. You keep your composure only by clenching your fists until they tear.Harker’s smile widens.\n“Better. You’re learning.”\nHe leaves you alone again, the untouched blood still gleaming on the table.Over time the rose on your lapel changes. Its glow dims, then begins to pulse faintly in rhythm with your heart. You start to sense things in it—memories that aren’t yours, impressions of other prisoners, other Thorns.🎲 Resolve + Occult (Difficulty 3) — to try to listen to the rose and understand what it’s showing you.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10, 9, 8, 7, 5 → 4 successes ✅The rose whispers fragments: “He fears the Prince. The garden lies beneath the house. The roots feed on Blood.”You see flashes of the mansion’s lower levels—vaulted cellars, ritual circles, chained Kindred whose vitae is being siphoned through roses carved into the stone.You know now that whatever Harker is doing, it isn’t just vanity—it’s something ancient and parasitic.The door clicks open again. A ghoul enters silently, setting down a basin of water and a clean shirt.\n“Lord Harker requests your presence this evening, sir,” he says quietly. “He says you’re ready to behave.”\nYou have options:\nPlay along, cleaned and courteous, to learn more about the “garden” below.\nFeign obedience, but prepare to escape or strike.\nReach out through the rose, try to call to the others you sensed.\nWhich does Lucien choose?Lucian laughed. \"Am I now? Does he think me broken? I'm far from that... \" he mocked, running a hand through his long silvery hair.\"Tell him to go fuck himself.. or better yet, come here and I'll fuck him instead.\" He said in a polite tone but clearly mockingThe ghoul’s lips twitch into a near-smile at your answer — the kind of thing that only comes from someone who’s seen the game a dozen times and knows the stakes. He inclines his head with a perfect, practiced politeness.\n“Very well, sir.”\nHe steps from the room and closes the door with a soft click.The silence is immediate and full. The fire hisses. You sit very still, the echo of your own words hanging in the air like a dare.Footsteps on the stairwell — slow, measured, and coming closer. The handle turns. The door opens and Sir Reginald enters without so much as a knock. He pauses in the doorway, the lamplight drawing his profile into a carved, animal calm. For the barest instant he simply looks at you, and it’s like being weighed on a blade.He does not laugh.\nHe does not smile.\n“Bold,” he says quietly. “Rude. Entertaining.”\nHe crosses the room in two long strides and drops into the chair opposite, folding one leg over the other as if you are in private theatre rather than private prison. His voice is silk. The look in his eyes is not. “You have the mouth of a street brawler and the airs of a gentleman. That contradiction has always amused me. But amusement grows thin.”\nHe reaches into his pocket and produces a folded handkerchief, blotting at the corner of his lip as if tidying a minor imperfection. His fingers brush the rose at your lapel with a casual cruelty, and you feel the pin shiver against your chest like something alive.\n“You will learn, Lucien,” he says. “You will learn that insolence is an expensive indulgence. You will learn that some debts are not paid with apologies.”\nWithout rising, he speaks an order and the ghoul re-enters. Two more follow, heavy-shouldered and quick-eyed. They don’t speak; they only wait.Reginald stands now, taking from the table a small leather-bound book. He opens it, turns a page as if reading from some ledger, and then snaps it shut.\n“You will sweep the conservatory at dawn,” he announces, his voice flat and final. “You will mend the frames in the gallery. You will not go hungry tonight because I said you may not — you will go hungry because you have earned the lesson. If you break my rules again I will decide what discipline is fitting.”\nHe leans close—still not smiling—and drops his voice so that everything in the room feels like a promise of winter:\n“You are needed, little thief. But need does not equal mercy.”\nThen he gestures. The guards move with quiet efficiency. They seize you gently but with iron certainty — a hand at each elbow, another at your shoulders. They haul you to your feet. There is no theatrical shouting, no dramatics: the violence is efficient, practical, intended to remove dignity rather than to kill. One cuffed press of a baton to the ribs, a shove that sends you sprawling to your knees — harsh, practiced.You are moved to the corridor and then past the servants’ wing toward the lower rooms. As you go, Reginald watches from the study doorway, a dark coin of satisfaction folding his features.When the door closes behind you, the house is a different place: the music and warm laughter of the assembly are distant memories, and the hush of consequence hangs thick. The guards set you down in a narrow antechamber. One of them offers a small basin of water; another brushes dirt from your sleeve. It’s contempt dressed up as caretaking.You are left with a cracked lip, a bruised rib, and the faint but persistent throb of the rose against your heart. The hunger gnaws at the edges — not satiated, only sharpened by denial.You clean yourself, as always, with the same stubborn dignity: brush your hair until it lies right, press the collar flat, dab the blood from your mouth. The ritual steadies you, but it does not fill the emptiness. Reginald’s words echo in your head like a metronome: needed, not mercy.Options present themselves like knives on a tray. You can:\nPlay the patient pet — learn more, wait for a moment to strike when he lets his guard fall.\nUse the rose’s whispering glimpses to try to find allies in the house (call to the Thorns you sensed).\nMake a risky break for it that night while the house sleeps — run for the streets and the Prince’s protection.\nWhich does Lucien choose?Staring into the reflection in the water. Lucian laughed, a full hearty laugh. He laughed until his voice was horse.. He decided on the plan. One more, one more big push and then he'll break. He'll break because that's what the show demanded. Like a theatre, he'd break and be taken along like a good pet. Taken right to the point where they wanted him, and then he'd emerge, unbroken, false, an actor in their stage.He didn't do what they told him to, he waited until the next time Sir Reginald came and talked to him. Then... attacked. A full on, no holds attack. An act of last stand, last desperado. He expected to lose. To be taken to the edge. He had faith in his own soul and mind. He would not truely be broken,You spend the hours before dusk in the ritual of preparation—hands steady, movements deliberate. Every button done, every thread smoothed. You rehearse the collapse you intend to give him, the play within the play. The hunger gnaws at you, hollowing out the nerves until laughter is the only thing left to fill the space.When the door opens at last and Sir Reginald steps in, the scene is already set. He expects the obedient Lucien, the tamed artist who will bow and speak softly. What he gets instead is motion—a blur of white shirt and silver hair.🎲 Strength + Brawl (6 dice) vs Dexterity + Brawl (Reginald 7 dice)\n(Rolling automatically.)\nLucien: 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, 4 → 4 successes\nReginald: 10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3 → 4 successes\n⚔️ Clash of equals.\nThe two of you meet mid-stride; the impact shakes the room. Books scatter, glass breaks. For an instant you have him—then he has you—each reversal punctuated by the sound of struggle rather than words.Reginald’s voice is low, almost admiring even as he fights you off:\n“There it is again. The soldier. The theatre. The beast.”\nHe slams you into the wall; you claw back, nails catching his cheek. Vitae streaks down his face. He laughs, furious and delighted all at once.🎲 Rouse Check to push the Beast for strength.\n→ Success (no Hunger increase).You surge, twisting free, driving him back a step. The two of you crash against the desk, and the rose on your chest ignites—light spilling from it like a flare. It sears both of you. Reginald snarls and seizes your wrist, forcing the pin between his fingers.\n“You don’t even understand what you carry!”\nHe wrenches; the rose snaps free, blood on the pin. You feel the psychic tear as it leaves you—a sudden emptiness, a silence where the whispers once lived.🎲 Stamina + Resolve (Difficulty 4) — to stay conscious under the backlash.\n→ 10, 9, 8, 5 → 3 successes ❌ FailThe room tilts. You drop to your knees. Reginald stands over you, breathing hard, the rose’s glow now pulsing in his palm.\n“You wanted to act, Lucien? Then act your death well.”\nHe raises a hand—but something stops him. He stares at the rose, confusion flickering across his face. The glow shifts colour—no longer his crimson but your own colder silver. A backlash of energy throws him a step backward.You fall sideways into darkness, half-aware of shouting, of the guards rushing in, of Reginald’s command—“Don’t kill him. Not yet.”When you wake, you’re in chains in a deeper room—stone walls, the air thick with Aetheric residue. The rose lies on the floor near your hand, dim but still pulsing. It is no longer his.Lucien’s status:\nHunger 4 (starving)\nWillpower 2/7\nSuperficial damage: heavy\nCondition: Imprisoned, rose detached but resonant with him\nYou have one faint advantage: whatever happened in that flare has shaken Reginald’s control. Guards whisper outside; the rose still responds when you focus on it.Would you like to:\nExplore the cell, using Auspex or Celerity to find a way out,\nReach through the rose again to sense what it now connects to, or\nWait and feign weakness until Reginald returns to finish what he started?\nLucian laid there, whimpering, crying quietly. Mumbling about the decour, the clothing.. a bath.. He crawled to the door, begging for them to give him blood, give him a bath. Get him out of this horid cell. That he'd do anything. That he was sorry...The stone floor is cold enough to bite through cloth. Every movement smears the dried blood at your wrists into the dirt. The cell smells of rust, of dust, of the faint metallic tang that never quite goes away in places where Kindred bleed.You make the sound that the role demands: small, hoarse sobs, the plea of someone who has finally been stripped of pride. You pull yourself to the heavy door and rest your forehead against it.\n“Please… a bath. Just—just a bath, please.”\nThe guards outside exchange a few words; the scrape of boots. One of them laughs softly under his breath, but there’s an edge of uncertainty to it.\n“He’s breaking,” one mutters.\n“Maybe. Lord’ll want to see it himself.”\nYou hear the key turn. A sliver of light cuts across the floor, widening as the door creaks open.The younger of the two guards steps in, holding a lamp and a silver flask.\n“You ask nice, maybe I can bring a bit of water later. No tricks, right?”\nHe crouches just far enough to study you through the bars of light, the smell of his mortal blood thick and real. The rose near your hand throbs once, answering the hunger twisting in your gut.🎲 Composure + Subterfuge (Difficulty 3) — to keep the act convincing, to look helpless rather than ready.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 9, 8, 7, 5, 4 → 3 successes ✅You sell it perfectly. The guard relaxes, lamp dipping a little lower, his voice turning almost gentle.\n“There now. That’s better. We’ll clean you up tomorrow.”\nHe reaches out a cautious hand to set the flask near you—close enough to take if you lunge, close enough that you can smell the copper inside. The other guard stands in the doorway, bored, not watching closely.You can:\nKeep the act going, take the flask quietly, use the chance to gather strength.\nStrike suddenly, use the proximity and hunger to overpower them.\nWhisper through the rose, see if its pulse can distract or influence them.\nWhat does Lucien do?Lucian quickly grabs the flask, drinking every last drop as he played the pathetic broken artistYou snatch the flask like a drowning man taking a rope. The guard startles but doesn’t stop you; you’ve played the broken thing too well. The metal is cold, but the scent spilling from it is warm, rich, alive.The first mouthful burns down your throat, fire and copper. The second sends the Beast howling through your chest, every nerve alight. You force it down with clenched jaw and will, swallowing every drop until the flask is bone-dry.🎲 Hunger roll:\n→ Success — Hunger drops from 4 → 2.You breathe—out of habit, not need—and wipe your mouth with a shaking hand. The guard kneels to take the flask back, the smallest trace of sympathy in his face.\n“There. Easy, easy. Lord’ll be pleased you’re finally behaving.”\nHe straightens, nodding to his partner, and they start to close the door again. You’re left with a faint pulse of strength, the taste of blood still on your tongue, and the dim, steady glow of the rose where it lies on the floor.It hums faintly now—quieter than before, but clearer. Beneath the heartbeat is a whisper of other minds: tired, frightened, waiting.If you reach for it, you might be able to touch them—the other “Thorns” you glimpsed in the visions.\nOr you can bide your time, stay small and docile until another chance to get closer to the surface presents itself.Would you like to reach out through the rose, or keep the mask on and wait?Lucian waited for a while ,curled up in the corner. Tentivily listening to everything outside.The door shuts with a heavy clack and the lock’s teeth turn twice.\nYou curl into the corner and let the quiet swallow the room.For a long while there’s only the sound of your own shallow breaths and the slow drip of water somewhere in the dark. The hunger hums but no longer burns; the rose’s faint pulse marks the passing of time better than any clock.You listen. Carefully.🎲 Wits + Awareness (Difficulty 3)\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10 9 8 7 4 → 4 successes ✅You catch every small noise beyond the stone: boots on wood, the rasp of keys, a door opening and closing. A woman’s voice—one of the household staff, calm and deferential. Then Harker’s, lower, smoother.\n“No. He’s not to be fed again until I say so.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\n“Have the others ready for transport to the garden by dawn. The ritual resumes tomorrow.”\nTheir steps fade. The house settles again into that thick, muffled quiet peculiar to old estates.The phrase “transport to the garden” sticks in your head. You’ve heard it before in the rose’s whispers; whatever is happening down there is about to happen again.Time drifts. At some point a faint draft slides under the door, carrying the scent of roses and old soil. The rose on the floor brightens slightly, its pulse syncing to your own.You’re alone, but you know more now:\nThe ritual is coming soon.\nHarker thinks you’re broken enough not to interfere.\nThe rose is still connected to something—or someone—below.\nYou can:\nReach through the rose now, to learn what’s in the “garden.”\nWait for the guards’ shift change and prepare an escape.\nFeign obedience at dawn, let them take you to the ritual site itself.\nWhich does Lucien choose?Lucian leans up to the door, peeking through his face gently in the bars. Seeing the guards.He begs for more blood, for clean clothes, for a bath. Begs them for information. \"What will they do with me.\"The corridor beyond the door glows with the dull orange light of a single lantern. Two guards stand in its halo, one leaning on the wall, the other idly rolling a cigarette.You press your face to the bars, voice soft and trembling.\n“Please… I just need a bath. Clean clothes. Tell me what’s going to happen. What will he do with me?”\nThe standing guard snorts and keeps his eyes on the end of his cigarette. The younger one—nervous, new—glances your way and then away again.\n“Don’t ask that, mate,” the older says.\n“He’s going to find out anyway,” the younger mutters. “What’s the harm?”\nA quiet argument follows. Finally the younger steps closer. You can see the sheen of sweat on his neck, smell the human pulse beneath his collar.\n“They say you’re part of it,” he whispers. “That there’s this… garden under the house. The lord says he’s growing something down there. They bring the others to it, the ones like you. They don’t come back up.”\nHe glances down the corridor, lowers his voice further.\n“It’s not my business, right? I just keep the doors locked.”\n🎲 Manipulation + Persuasion (Difficulty 3) — to draw him in a little closer, get more out of him.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 9, 8, 8, 6, 5, 4 → 3 successes ✅You speak softly, just enough desperation to sound genuine.\n“Please… you’re kind to tell me. Just—tell me what it looks like. What does he grow down there?”\nThe guard hesitates.\n“Roses,” he says finally. “White ones. They feed off… blood, I think. There’s a machine that pumps it through pipes in the walls. The others—Kindred—are chained to it. Their blood keeps the flowers alive.”\nHe steps back quickly, eyes darting down the hall.\n“Forget I said anything. If he finds out I talked, I’m next.”\nHe retreats to his post. The older guard shakes his head, muttering,\n“You’re too soft, lad.”\nTheir voices fade again into low conversation.The rose on the floor pulses once, faintly in time with the word roses—a sympathetic tremor, as if it’s part of that same garden.You have enough to plan:\nThe ritual involves draining Kindred to feed the white roses.\nThe network runs through the walls beneath the estate.\nThe guards are mortal, not ghouled—one of them might be turned with the right pressure or promise.\nWould you like Lucien to try to influence the young guard again through the rose, wait for the next guard rotation to act, or use what you’ve learned to attempt a physical escape tonight?Lucian tries to get to the young guard, through suggestive comments of using Lucians body, of entertaining him. Being a flirt and sexual deviant. He needs the information so he could plan. (Its not g oing to be sexual. just that he'd suggest things to try and entice t he guard)2/2The trick works best when you make it look effortless. You soften your voice, smooth the raw edge of the begging out of it. You keep your eyes low and the tone somewhere between exhausted and amused.\n“You’re the only one here who even talks to me,” you murmur. “The others just stare. It’s lonely, being a museum piece. You could keep me company for five minutes, couldn’t you? No one would notice.”\nThe guard freezes, the cigarette halfway to his lips. A flicker of color touches his face.\nHe doesn’t step closer, but he doesn’t move away either.🎲 Manipulation + Persuasion (Difficulty 3)\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10 9 8 7 4 → 4 successes ✅The performance lands: just enough suggestion to snare attention, not enough to turn the scene into something it isn’t.\nHe clears his throat, glancing down the corridor to make sure the older guard isn’t watching.\n“You shouldn’t talk like that,” he mutters. “If he heard—”\nYou let a faint smile show, the sort that invites confidence rather than promise.\n“Then help me stop talking. Tell me something to think about instead. What’s really under this place? You’ve seen more than anyone else will admit.”\nHe hesitates again, torn between fear and curiosity, then lowers his voice.\n“There’s a lift in the western wing. It goes below the cellars. You need two keys—one the steward has, one the lord himself keeps on a chain. They take the prisoners down in batches, always before sunrise. And there’s a side tunnel, for bringing in the workers who keep the pumps running. That’s all I know.”\nHe steps back quickly, forcing a shrug.\n“I shouldn’t even have said that much.”\nYou nod, still playing the tired, grateful captive.\n“You’ve said enough. Thank you.”\nThe older guard calls him over, breaking the moment. You’re left with the rhythm of their footsteps and the new piece of the map in your head: a lift, two keys, a tunnel.You can:\nWait and use this knowledge when they come to move you to the ritual site.\nTry to reach the young guard again later, press him to bring one of the keys.\nReach through the rose to see if the other prisoners in the garden can hear you.\nWhat does Lucien do?Lucian begs to speak to Sir ReginaldYour voice cuts through the quiet again, hoarse but steady this time.\n“Please… please, I need to speak to Lord Harker. Tell him I— I understand now. I’ll cooperate.”\nYou pitch it right between desperation and sincerity; the sound of someone who’s finally broken but wants to make it right.The guards look at each other. The younger one chews the inside of his cheek; the older sighs through his nose.\n“You’ll keep on until he comes down here just to shut you up, won’t you?”\n“He wants him alive,” the younger reminds him.\n“Aye, for now,” the older says, then turns to the door. “Quiet, then. I’ll send a message up.”\nHe leaves, the younger guard staying behind, glaring at the floor. Time stretches: ten minutes, twenty. Then the echo of boots—measured, deliberate.Sir Reginald appears in the corridor, immaculate as ever. The rose-pinned cravat, the gloves, the calm expression that makes everything worse. The guards step aside.\n“You called for me,” he says evenly, pausing just beyond the bars. “It must be important, to risk irritating me again.”\nHe doesn’t sound angry; he sounds curious, the way a collector might be when a broken instrument hums unexpectedly.\n“Speak, Lucien. What could you possibly want from me now?”\nYou can answer him however you choose—plead, deceive, or confront. What does Lucien say?Lucian got to his knee's, peering throug hthe bars, begging to be let go, begging that he'd behave, that he'd be his little pet, do anything he wants, dote on his arm and do anything. He'd kill the prince if he asks. Lucian puts on all his acting skills to convince him.You kneel until the stone bites into your knees, letting the tremor in your voice come through. The words spill in a rush—apologies, promises, devotion. You keep your eyes just shy of meeting his, as though afraid of what you might see there.\n“Please, my lord. I’ll do anything you ask. You were right about me—I’m nothing without guidance. I’ll behave. I’ll sit at your side, smile when you wish it, serve you as you deserve. I’ll even deal with the Prince if that’s what you want. Just… don’t leave me down here.”\n🎲 Manipulation + Performance (Difficulty 4)\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10 9 8 8 6 5 4 → 4 successes ✅The mask holds perfectly; every word sounds like surrender.Reginald studies you for a long moment. The silence stretches until it’s almost unbearable. Then he exhales through his nose, a small sound that could be approval or amusement.\n“Look at you,” he says quietly. “Almost believable.”\nHe steps closer to the bars, crouching so that his eyes are level with yours.\n“You should have been an actor instead of an artist. But the world doesn’t need more actors; it needs instruments.”\nHe reaches through the bars, taking your chin between two gloved fingers. The gesture isn’t gentle, but it isn’t cruel either—it’s ownership made physical.\n“If you mean what you say, you’ll prove it soon. There’s another ritual at dawn. If you behave, if you’re… useful… perhaps I’ll let you walk beside me again. If you don’t—”\nHe releases your chin, wipes his fingers on a handkerchief.\n“Then I’ll hang your portrait in the garden as a reminder of wasted potential.”\nHe stands, smooths his coat.\n“Clean him,” he orders the guards. “He performs tomorrow.”\nThe door opens. Two servants enter with a basin and fresh clothes. They keep their eyes down, moving quickly, leaving behind a scent of rosewater.You’ve bought yourself a place in whatever happens next. You can:\nGo along with the cleaning and preparations, keeping up the act to reach the ritual unharmed.\nTry to speak again while the servants work, slip them a whisper or a question.\nUse the time alone afterward to focus on the rose and the other Thorns before dawn.\nWhich path does Lucien take?Lucian goes along, playing the part. Telling Reginald he isn't acting, trying to prove he isn't lying. And lets the servents clean him and give him a new outfit. Even taken to a cleaner more formal guest room.The servants move with that brisk, wordless efficiency that only long habit can teach. They strip away the grime with warm water and rose-scented soap; every pass of the cloth erases the weeks of captivity until your skin feels raw but human again. They dress you in dark tailored clothes—something that looks like evening wear from another century—and leave without a word.When they’re gone, the silence in the new room feels almost foreign. It’s still a cage, but this one smells of polished wood and lavender oil, not rot. A mirror hangs opposite the bed. For the first time in weeks you see yourself properly: leaner, eyes too bright, but standing straight. You force a smile into the reflection, the kind of smile that convinces an audience.A knock at the door.\nThe same younger guard appears, a little uncertain now.\n“Lord Harker says you’re to rest. He’ll send for you before sunrise.”\nHe lingers, looking over your clothes, the restored image of you.\n“You really meant all that down there?”\nYou let the voice stay soft.\n“I meant every word.”\nHe nods once and leaves, locking the door quietly.You sit on the edge of the bed. The house is still, the hour late. Beneath the calm façade, something has shifted: Reginald believes he has won. You have access again—enough freedom to move, to see, to act when the moment comes.You can:\nKeep the mask on until sunrise, let them escort you to the ritual to see the garden with your own eyes.\nSearch the room now that you’re alone; there might be something useful hidden here.\nFocus inward, reach through the rose and try to contact the other “Thorns” before they bring you below.\nWhat does Lucien choose?Sitting there on the bed, now in a clamer mind. He reaches out to the RoseYou steady your breathing—habit more than need—and press your palm flat against the place where the rose rests against your chest. The petals of the pin are cold at first, then warm; the warmth spreads under your skin like ink drawn into paper.You close your eyes.🎲 Resolve + Occult (Difficulty 3)\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10 9 8 6 4 → 4 successes ✅The world narrows to a heartbeat and a faint scent of soil. When you open your senses, the sound is not one voice but many, whispering through the dark like wind through thorns.Fragments reach you:\n“…beneath the house…”\n“…white roots…feed on us…”\n“…one rose still free…a thief among us…”\nThe impressions are jumbled—fear, exhaustion, a dozen minds half-conscious and drained. Then one thread grows clearer, a voice steadier than the rest:\n“If you can hear this, you’re not bound yet. The roses link through the roots—through blood and thought. Follow the pulse in the walls. It leads to the stem, to the heart. Break the heart and the garden dies.”\nThe connection flickers; you feel another presence briefly—Reginald’s—moving through the same network, cold and searching. You pull back before it finds you.When you open your eyes again, the room is still. The rose is dull metal once more, its warmth fading, but the echo of those words remains: Follow the pulse in the walls. Break the heart.You now know:\nThe “garden” is a living construct under the house.\nThe network of roses connects every captive through blood.\nDestroying its central “heart” will collapse the ritual.\nOutside the door you hear faint movement—guards changing shift, a tray being set down. There are still a few hours before dawn.Lucien can:\nSearch the walls now for the faint pulse the voice described.\nRest and gather strength for the ritual, intending to act when he’s taken below.\nTest the rose’s link again to see if he can reach the steadier voice directly.\nWhich does Lucien choose?Lucian takes the food, resting. Intending to act when he was taken belowYou eat just enough to quiet the tremor in your hands, wash down the copper taste that still lingers at the back of your throat. The food is a mortal’s meal—bread, a little meat, watered wine—and it does nothing for the hunger, but it gives the Beast something to focus on other than the scent of its own cage.The hours crawl past. The mansion above is quiet except for the occasional shift of wood, a clock somewhere striking the quarters. You lie back on the bed and watch the play of light across the ceiling until it fades entirely.When the door opens again, it’s still dark out; the lamps in the corridor burn low and blue. Two guards enter with the younger one from before at their head. He looks anywhere but directly at you.\n“Lord Harker asks for you,” he says. “It’s time.”\nThey lead you down a long spiral stair that grows colder with each step. The scent of roses thickens, no longer pleasant but cloying. The air hums faintly—machinery and something older than machinery. The corridor widens into a stone gallery, the walls veined with roots like white veins under translucent skin.At the end stands Sir Reginald Harker, immaculate as ever, flanked by attendants. Behind him, an elevator cage yawns open; its floor and ceiling are latticed metal, and the sound from below it is the steady, rhythmic beat of something enormous pumping.He turns as you approach, eyes bright with satisfaction.\n“Ah. My rose returns to the garden.”\nHe gestures to the elevator.\n“Come, Lucien. The others are waiting, and dawn will not wait for us.”\nHe’s watching for defiance, for a single wrong step. The guards’ weapons hang ready but not raised. You can feel the pulse from the walls now, the same rhythm you touched through the rose.At this moment you can:\nGo along quietly into the lift, waiting to act once you see the heart of the garden.\nLook for a way to sabotage the lift or the machinery as you pass.\nTry to signal the young guard—the one who still seems uneasy—for help when Harker isn’t looking.\nWhat does Lucien do?Lucian steps forward in a sudden rush. Almost as if about to attack.When he wraps his arms around Sir Reginalds shoulders, pulling himself into the mans chest, kissing at his neck and cheeks and jaw. Playing the subservient pet and toy. Apologising, begging for forgiveness for attacking him.You move fast enough that the guards half-flinch, expecting another fight. Instead, you fall against Reginald like a penitent lover, arms looped around his shoulders, face pressed to his neck. The words tumble out between kisses and half-sobs—\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I was frightened… please forgive me. I only ever wanted to please you.”\nFor a moment his body stays rigid. Then his hands rise, not to push you away but to steady you by the arms. His voice is soft enough that only you hear it.\n“Lucien…”\n🎲 Manipulation + Performance (Difficulty 4)\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10 9 9 8 6 4 3 = 4 successes ✅The act lands perfectly. To everyone watching, it looks like complete submission, the broken toy crawling back to its master. Reginald’s posture relaxes, pride blooming through the surprise. He cups your jaw, forcing your gaze up to his.\n“There now,” he murmurs. “That’s what I wanted to see. The rose teaches, doesn’t it?”\nHe brushes the back of his gloved hand across your cheek, the gesture more claim than comfort.\n“You’ll walk beside me into the garden, and when the work is done, perhaps you’ll have your reward.”\nHe turns to the guards.\n“Lower your weapons. He understands his place.”\nThe elevator gate creaks open. Reginald guides you forward by the elbow, the two of you stepping into the metal cage together. As it begins to descend, the walls of the shaft glow with faint white veins pulsing in rhythm with the rose at your chest.The air grows warmer, damp with the scent of blood and earth. Somewhere far below, a heartbeat that isn’t yours thrums through the metal underfoot.Reginald watches you, amused and indulgent.\n“You see, my dear Lucien? Every creation needs a little theatre. Even gods like an audience.”\nThe lift slows. Through the lattice you glimpse the “garden”: a vast chamber of stone and root, white roses blooming from the walls, each flower fed by a pipe that glistens dark red.Reginald steps forward as the gate opens.\n“Welcome home.”\nThe guards wait for him to move first. You’re within arm’s reach, close enough to see the key hanging on the chain at his throat, to feel the tremor of the rose answering the pulse in the walls.Do you:\nKeep up the act, follow him into the garden to see the heart before striking.\nGo for the key now, trying to take control of the lift.\nUse the rose’s resonance, channel the pulse through yourself and into him.\nSlowly walking through the garden, Lucian holds out his hands to the flowers, but not close enough to let them touch. He wanders around..\"Tell me the truth my love...\" he stammered. \"Amd I going to die here?\"Reginald walks a pace behind you, hands clasped neatly at the small of his back. His shoes make no sound on the damp stone. The chamber breathes around you — the soft hiss of blood moving through the roots, the whisper of petals brushing one another.When you reach toward the nearest bloom, it leans slightly in your direction, a pale face seeking the scent of its donor. A single drop of crimson wells from its heart and slides down a stem like dew.Reginald’s voice comes quietly:\n“No, Lucien. You’ve already died once. What happens here is... adjustment.”\nHe moves closer, his reflection rippling across the sheen of blood pooled between the roots.\n“The others down here? They feed the roots, and the roots feed me. But you—”\nHis gloved hand touches your shoulder. “You are something rarer. The rose chose you. If you survive this night, you’ll be bound to me, to the garden, to the first memory of our kind. It will hurt, and then you will be perfect.”\nHe gestures around you.\n“Every petal, every stem, was born from one who resisted too long. Don’t resist, and you won’t join them.”\nThe pulse in the walls grows louder, matching the beat of your own undead heart. You can feel where the rhythm converges—deep in the chamber, a mass of roots throbbing with stored vitae. That must be the heart the other voice spoke of.You keep your expression carefully controlled, eyes downcast, voice small.You can:\nKeep up the act, let him lead you toward the heart and look for a moment to strike.\nTest him, ask questions to learn how the ritual works.\nPretend to yield fully, draw him close enough for physical contact again.\nWhat does Lucien do?\"Will.. I still be me?\" He asked in a nervous mumbleReginald stops beside you, his reflection shivering across the wet stone. For a long moment he doesn’t answer. When he does, it’s in the voice he reserves for art and prayer—soft, coaxing, too intimate to trust.\n“In the beginning, no one stays the same,” he says. “But you’ll be… better. What you are now is an unfinished sketch—lines without depth, color without weight.”\nHe steps around you, trailing his fingertips along the petals nearest your head.\n“The garden doesn’t erase; it completes. It takes the noise out of the blood, the chaos out of the Beast. You’ll still paint, still sing, still ache for beauty—but the hunger that drives you will finally have purpose.”\nHe turns back, eyes bright with conviction rather than cruelty.\n“So yes, Lucien. You’ll still be you. Only refined. Only mine.”\nThe words slide into you like silk over a blade. You can feel the rose against your chest begin to thrum faster; it’s reacting not to his promise, but to the pulse of the heart deeper in the chamber.You’re close now. The central mass of roots pulses in time with your body, faint light flickering beneath the bark where vitae flows. It’s a living engine.\nOne touch of the rose’s power might ignite or destroy it.Reginald watches you carefully.\n“Come. Touch it with me, and you’ll see.”\nYou can:\nPretend to obey, reach out but channel the rose’s energy into the heart instead of yourself.\nPull away, test his reaction, keep playing for time.\nAsk one last question, to draw him closer physically—close enough to grab the key.\nWhat does Lucien choose?Lucian turns, pressing himself into Sir Reginald, a soft loving smile on his lips. \"Kiss me.. one last time, so the last thing I will remember, if this does not work, is our love..\" he said in a soft tone.Reginald’s expression softens—genuine or expertly rehearsed, you can’t tell. The mask of the master slips into something tender, nostalgic.\n“You always did know how to turn pain into theatre,” he murmurs.\nHe cups your cheek with a gloved hand, the other resting lightly at your waist to draw you closer. The scent of roses and blood fills the air between you. When he leans in, his lips just brush yours, cool and precise, like a signature at the bottom of a painting.For a second, the guards look away, granting their lord his indulgence. It’s all the window you’ll get.You can feel the heat building behind your sternum—the rose responding to your intent, the walls around you pulsing faster.🎲 Resolve + Composure (Difficulty 4) — to hold the mask of devotion while you summon the power.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10 9 9 8 6 4 3 = 4 successes ✅You keep the smile, the kiss, the whispered breath against his lips; the performance perfect.

The pulse that connects every bloom in the chamber flows through you, through him, through the roots below.Reginald draws back, eyes half-lidded, whispering:\n“Now, my rose—touch the heart.”\nThe thrum in the walls answers you instead. The heartbeat that isn’t yours syncs to your own, waiting for your choice.You have one instant of control—enough to:\nChannel the rose into the heart, risking your own body to burn the garden from within.\nTurn the surge into Reginald, to destroy him through the bond you forged in the kiss.\nRelease the energy outward, trying to shatter the link binding every Thorn at once.\nWhat does Lucien do?With every ounce of strength of the soul and mind. Lucian smiles and says. \"For Marianne.\" He said with a leaned in kiss on Reginalds lips. Before pushing him into the heart. Tryuing not to let himself touch it.. The heart and the flowers consume Reginald but does nothing special. It does not break. Just consumes him. Going back to normal. Continuing this:The name leaves your lips like a prayer and a curse in one breath.“For Marianne.”Reginald’s eyes widen—just enough to register confusion—before your hands find his chest.

The next step carries him into the tangled mass of roots. They clutch at him like living wire;6/6The roots seize him instantly. Their movement is slow at first, almost curious, then hungry. Vines coil up around his arms and throat, white petals opening where they touch his skin. The hiss of blood through the veins of the garden deepens until the whole chamber vibrates with it.Reginald’s voice breaks into a snarl:\n“You fool—this isn’t how—”\nThe rest is swallowed as the mass drags him deeper. You see a flash of his eyes, still bright with the belief that he can command this place, and then the flowers close over his face. The pulsing slows, steadies, resumes its rhythm as if nothing at all has changed.You stand there trembling, the rose at your chest burning against your skin, the mark behind your ear throbbing in sympathetic pain. The scent of blood and roses fills your lungs. The guards stare, one frozen, the other backing away in horror.The garden settles. The white blooms sway gently, as though moved by a wind no one else can feel. The heart keeps beating, indifferent.The younger guard whispers, “He’s… he’s gone?”\nThe older shakes his head. “No one dies in this place. It just… takes them.”You’re left alone with the sound of the pump, the roots, and the rose. The power in the chamber hasn’t lessened; if anything, it’s waiting.You can:\nTouch the heart yourself—see if you can use what’s left of the bond to finish what he started and end it.\nFlee, using the stunned guards and the lift while the garden digests its master.\nReach through the rose again, now that Reginald’s influence has been consumed, to contact the other Thorns and try to free them.\nWhat does Lucien do?Turning to the guards. Lucian straightens his back.\"I have killed Sir Reginald Harker. I have killed your Lord. You can either kill me, or serve me!\" He bellowed. \"I claim the Rosethorn Pact for myself!\"Your shout hits the vaulted chamber like a hammer blow.\nThe words ring out, echoing between the stone and the roots until the entire garden seems to hold its breath.The guards freeze — their eyes dart between you and the place where Sir Reginald vanished. The older one takes a half-step back; the younger drops his weapon completely, the sound of metal clattering against stone far too loud.For the first time since you entered this place, the heart responds to you. The rhythm behind the walls falters, then adjusts to the cadence of your own pulse. The rose on your chest sears; it is no longer answering to Harker’s command.🎲 Charisma + Intimidation (Difficulty 4)\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10, 10, 9, 8, 6, 5 = 5 successes – Critical Success ✅The air thickens with the weight of the Beast and something older that has taken root in your blood. The guards feel it before they understand it — that instinct that makes mortals bow before a predator.The older man goes to one knee, muttering, “We serve, my lord.”\nThe younger follows, shaking, eyes wide.Behind you, the roses begin to open one by one, white petals slowly staining crimson. The heartbeat in the walls adjusts again, syncing with yours; you feel it listening.\n“The Pact is yours,” a voice whispers through the petals — not Harker’s, not any one of the prisoners, but the collective sigh of all who’ve fed this garden. “The roots remember every master. What will you make of them, Lucien Valemont?”\nYou stand in the centre of the chamber, the guards kneeling, the blood-flowers swaying toward you as though awaiting orders.\nThe rose pinned to your chest beats once more, in time with the living network around you.Lucien Valemont, last of the Thorns, now holds the heart of the Rosethorn Pact.Would you like the next scene to open with him claiming control of the garden — shaping what the Pact becomes under his rule — or with his return to the surface, carrying this new power into the world above?Lucian commands them to seal the chamber, to not release any of the prisoners already there and to summon his staff upstairs in the estate.The moment the command leaves your lips, the air in the chamber changes. The guards don’t question; the weight in your voice is enough.The older one bows his head.\n“As you command, my lord.”\nHe and the younger guard hurry to the wall levers. Iron shutters grind down over the side tunnels, the lift doors lock with a heavy clack. The veins of white running through the roots dim until they give off only the faintest glow. The groans of the imprisoned Kindred fade to muffled echoes behind the sealed walls.The garden grows still again—obedient.You turn to the guards.\n“No one touches the flowers. No one enters this chamber without my leave. Send word to the house: my staff, the stewards, the servants who know my hand, they are to attend me at once.”\nThey bow and move to obey. The lift rattles as they ascend; you are left in the heart of the chamber, surrounded by the slow, living rhythm of the roses.When you follow them up, the estate feels different. The hallways are quiet, the portraits along the walls seem to follow your steps. By the time you reach the main floor, several of the household staff—human and ghoul alike—are waiting in the drawing room. Their expressions are confused, frightened. The young guard kneels at the doorframe, announcing in a trembling voice:\n“Lord Harker is gone. Lord Valemont… commands the house.”\nThe murmurs die. Dozens of eyes turn toward you. The rose at your lapel glows faintly beneath the fabric, its pulse steady.This is your first moment of real control—everything Harker built is here: the estate, the servants, the artifacts, the network of influence he cultivated in London.You can:\nClaim the estate formally, establishing yourself as the new master of the Rosethorn Pact and reshaping its purpose.\nBurn the evidence, dissolve the household and hide the truth of what happened below before the Prince hears.\nUse Harker’s power base, sending word to the Prince yourself to dictate the narrative of Harker’s “death.”\nWhich does Lucien choose?Lucian announces his claiming of the estate. That he has spoken with the Prince, which is false, that he is the new Master of the Estate and that if they wish to leave, they may, with full pay. Showing a kindess if any wish to leave.The staff gathers in a half-circle before the grand staircase, faces pale and eyes downcast. The faint perfume of the house—rose oil and old dust—hangs heavy. You straighten your jacket, let the silence stretch just long enough to draw every gaze to you.\n“Lord Harker’s service to the Prince is concluded,” you begin, voice calm and resonant. “I have spoken with His Grace, and he has confirmed the succession. From this night forward, this estate falls under my stewardship.”\nThe lie comes out smooth; no tremor, no hesitation.\n🎲 Manipulation + Persuasion (Difficulty 3)\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 10 9 8 7 6 4 = 4 successes ✅Even the most skeptical among them falters. A few of the ghouls exchange glances, then bow their heads in acceptance. The mortals follow their lead—servants, stewards, clerks—each bending slightly at the waist.You lift a hand.\n“You are not prisoners. Anyone who wishes to leave may do so. Your wages will be paid in full, and safe passage arranged. Those who remain will continue to serve as before. This house will not forget loyalty, nor punish honesty.”\nFor a long moment, no one moves. Then a handful—mostly the youngest—step back quietly. You nod to one of the stewards.\n“See that they have what they need.”\nThe tension breaks; the rest of the staff seem to breathe again. The younger guard who once brought you blood bows low.\n“My lord Valemont,” he says, trying the name for the first time. “What are your orders for the house?”\nThe mansion waits, still and watchful, the pulse of the garden faint beneath the floors. Every part of Harker’s empire—his art collections, his contacts, his secrets—is now at your disposal.You can:\nBegin consolidating power, sending messages to Harker’s allies and reshaping the Pact in your image.\nSecure the estate, locking it down to study the garden and its powers before revealing yourself to the outside world.\nSummon the Prince, gambling that the lie you told can become truth through boldness.\nWhat does Lucien choose to do next?With a chuckle to himself. Lucian nods to the younger guard. \"I think a funeral will be needed, a Wake, for the Lords passing.\" he said softly. \"I will paint a portrait for him. Go to my home, summon my staff here, Tell Evelyn that everything is 'peachy'. She will understand.\"The young guard nods quickly, relief flashing through his expression at the normalcy of your tone.\n“At once, my lord.”\nHe hurries off down the corridor, boots echoing against the marble as he disappears through the tall doors. The rest of the household remains, waiting for instruction. You can feel their tension ebbing slightly; the estate is returning to its old rhythm, only now it beats to your pulse.You let the smile linger as you survey the hall.\n“We’ll hold a wake for Lord Harker in three nights’ time. He will be honored properly—music, wine, art, all that he valued. And I will paint him as I remember him: brilliant, terrible, beautiful. A reminder that every garden needs pruning.”\nThe staff murmur assent. You turn toward the grand windows; dawn’s first faint grey light outlines the glass, but it does not reach inside.The new steward—an older ghoul who has clearly decided survival is worth adaptation—bows.\n“Shall I prepare your studio, sir?” “Yes,” you reply. “And air out the east wing. That will be mine.”\nHe bows again and retreats to his duties.For a moment, you are alone in the vast foyer. The rose at your lapel still warms faintly, but no longer burns; the rhythm that once belonged to Harker now rests in your chest, steady and obedient. You glance up the staircase toward the locked doors of the study, where his books and ledgers wait, and then down the corridor to the garden shaft where the heart still beats below.You have won, but the victory hums with a question: what will you make of the Rosethorn Pact now that it’s yours?Would you like the next scene to follow the wake and Lucien’s public re-emergence in Kindred society, or to move into the private night before the wake, where he begins the portrait and hears the garden whisper for the first time under his command?Lucian returns to the bedroom where Sir Reginald had slept, and had used him often enough.He waited for Evelyn to comeYou make your way through the quiet halls, the weight of the house pressing in on you with each step. The scent of roses lingers faintly everywhere now, the perfume a permanent part of the wood.Reginald’s bedchamber waits at the top of the stairs — the same room where you’d been used, broken, “tamed.” The servants have already been through it: the bed made, the sheets replaced, the evidence of violence scrubbed away until the place looks almost serene.You close the door behind you and sit on the edge of the bed. The mattress is soft enough to swallow the sound of movement. The rose at your chest thrums once, then quiets.The house below remains alive with activity — servants shifting furniture, whispers about the new lord. Through the wall, you can just make out the faint murmur of the garden’s heart, deeper now, slower.Time passes.\nA knock: quiet, familiar.\n“My lord?”\nEvelyn’s voice — careful, uncertain. When you tell her to enter, she does so slowly, eyes taking in the room, then you.\n“They said you sent for me.”\nA pause. “You look… well. Considering.”\nShe closes the door behind her, still cautious, still studying you for cues.\n“You said everything was ‘peachy’. That was our code for when it wasn’t. What happened, Lucien?”\nShe’s the only one who would dare ask directly.You can tell her the truth about Harker and the garden, conceal the supernatural parts and keep her loyal, or draw her fully into your confidence and the new Pact.\nWhat does Lucien do?\"I.. killed him. Eve... I killed reginald.. and Now I have to tell the Prince.\" He said softly. Walking over and pulling her into a hug, He needed his motherly figure. Her strenght. Her stoic words.\"This place, there is an evil secret.. I dont think I can tell anyone..\"Evelyn stiffens for a heartbeat, then her arms come up around you automatically, the way they always have. She smells of old perfume and ink, a faint reminder of the nights spent cataloguing your library. She lets you rest your forehead on her shoulder until your breathing evens out.\n“Lucien,” she says quietly. “You did what you had to. I saw what that man was turning you into.”\nShe leans back enough to look you in the eye, both hands on either side of your face. The old steadiness is there; it’s what you sought.\n“Listen to me. You don’t tell the Prince the truth. You tell him a story that keeps him from looking too closely. A duel, a challenge, a mistake during some ritual—something that lets him think it’s all finished.”\nShe moves past you, closing the curtains so that the first grey threads of dawn can’t reach in.\n“Whatever’s down there, lock it away. You’re not strong enough yet to make sense of it, and the rest of the city doesn’t need to know it exists.”\nShe returns to you, voice softer.\n“You survived, my love. That’s what matters now. You can build something new on this ruin—but only if you stop bleeding for the dead.”\nThe house creaks around you, settling. The pulse beneath the floor answers faintly to your heartbeat, as if acknowledging your choice to keep its secret.Evelyn squeezes your hand once.\n“We’ll draft the letter to the Prince tomorrow night. For now, you need rest. Let the servants believe what they will. Let the world think Harker’s gone to dust.”\nYou can feel the exhaustion starting to take hold—the kind that’s part hunger, part relief.Do you:\nRest here until the next night, letting Evelyn handle the estate’s surface affairs?\nInsist on writing to the Prince immediately, controlling the narrative yourself?\nReturn to the garden alone before dawn, needing to see for yourself that Reginald is truly gone?\n\"No. I will speak to him. Adrian is my friend. i owe him that. I ... will lie to him. About the Rosethorn.. but.. I will tell him it is done and he does not need to worry. I just know I will need to be punished for Reginalds death.\"Evelyn studies you for a long moment. The lines around her mouth deepen, the faint tremor in her hands betraying the worry she keeps hidden from everyone else.\n“Then you go to him,” she says quietly, “but you go as the man you want him to see. Not as Harker’s victim, and not as the thing this house tried to make of you. You go as Lucien Valemont — Toreador, artist, and servant of the Prince.”\nShe moves to the dresser, finds your coat, brushes it off, and lays it across your shoulders herself. The gesture is simple, almost ceremonial.\n“Adrian won’t punish you if you give him a way to turn this into order. You say Harker was dabbling in forbidden art, that you stopped it before it could stain the city. You offer the estate to the Prince’s use, and you let him think he’s taking care of you.”\nShe gives a faint, tired smile.\n“That’s how you survive princes. You let them protect you while you do what you must.”\nYou feel the steadying weight of her hand at your back. The dawn light is gone now, hidden behind heavy curtains; the house waits in silence.\n“Feed,” she says softly. “Dress. When night falls, we’ll call a carriage and you’ll go to Adrian. You’ll tell him what you need him to believe.”\nLater, as you stand in front of the mirror again, you almost don’t recognize yourself: clean, composed, the faint glow of the rose hidden beneath the collar of your coat. The estate hums quietly around you, obedient.When night comes, Evelyn will see you to the door and the carriage that will carry you to the Prince’s court.Would you like the next scene to open at the Prince’s residence, with Lucien giving his account of Reginald’s death, or in the carriage with Evelyn, planning every word of the lie on the way there?\"You were always smarter than everyone I knew.\" he smiled. \"I wish you'd let me turn you. You'd make such a wonderful bride.\" He sighed lovingly. Staring at her as she got his things together.Evelyn laughs under her breath, the sound low and warm in the quiet room. She keeps folding clothes, her back partly to you, and shakes her head.\n“You say that every few years,” she says. “And every time I remind you that you need someone in this house who still has a heartbeat.”\nShe looks over her shoulder, eyes softening.\n“If I let you turn me, who would remind you when you start to drift? Who would tell you when you’re about to do something stupid in the name of beauty?”\nShe finishes with your gloves, laying them beside your coat, and crosses the room to straighten the knot of your cravat with quick, practiced fingers. Her voice lowers.\n“You have eternity, Lucien. Let me have the rest of my little life. It’s better this way. You get to keep a piece of the world that’s still alive.”\nShe leans forward, presses a brief kiss to your cheek, then meets your eyes again.\n“Now. Go do what needs to be done. Come back before dawn and tell me it’s over.”\nOutside the shutters, the city begins to wake; inside, the mansion waits in stillness, all of it yours to command. The carriage bell rings once in the courtyard below.Do you want the next scene to open in the carriage with Evelyn, as you rehearse what to tell the Prince, or at the Prince’s court, as you stand before Adrian to deliver the story?The next day, after resting. Lucian went to see the Prince. Wearing his formal attire,The next night, you wake before sunset and take your time dressing. Every movement feels deliberate—polishing the mask until it gleams. Black velvet coat, silver cravat, gloves soft as skin. You choose one ring only: the signet you once wore as a mortal artist, not the mark of the Pact.By the time the carriage stops in front of the Prince’s Hall—a converted Georgian museum now used as Elysium—the sky is a deep indigo. The mortal attendants on the steps bow without looking directly at you. Inside, the familiar scent of varnish and candle wax greets you like a stage memory.Prince Adrian Vale, your friend, sits in the center of the hall beneath the marble statue of Persephone, the unofficial symbol of rebirth among the Kindred of London. The court is smaller than usual; he’s dismissed the hangers-on for privacy. His voice is steady when he speaks your name.\n“Lucien. Come forward.”\nYou kneel by custom, rising only when he gestures. The faintest smile touches his mouth—an echo of friendship, not warmth.\n“Word reached me that Sir Reginald’s estate has changed hands. I thought it best to hear the truth from you before the gossip mills turn it into theatre.”\nThe silence that follows is deliberate. He’s giving you space to set the tone—to confess, to justify, to spin.Evelyn’s voice lingers in your memory: Let him think he’s protecting you while you do what you must.You have a few angles you can take:\nThe loyal servant’s report — Harker fell to forbidden experiments, and you ended it to protect the Prince’s domain.\nThe tragic accident — A ritual misfire; you barely survived.\nA carefully shaded confession — Admit your part in Harker’s death but frame it as loyalty to Adrian.\nWhich story does Lucien choose to tell?\"I killed him.\" Lucian said simply. \"I killed him and destroyed his body.\" He sighed, standing formally. \"You... were right. He was attempting something. There are those who were involved but they did not know the scale or the endgame. I believe they should not be punished and I will not give you their names.\" He said firmly.\"I have committed a sin amongst our kind, and I should be punished.\" He knelt, head down. \"Even with our youth, our friendship. I am shamed. No one but I knows the truth of the matter.\" He lied again, the two guards did. Only them.The chamber goes very still. Adrian doesn’t move; the only sound is the low hiss of the gas lamps. When he finally speaks, his tone is measured—not angry, not yet.\n“You understand what that admission means, Lucien.”\nHe rises from the chair, hands clasped behind his back. The weight of his gaze feels heavier than any blow.\n“A Prince cannot overlook the slaying of a peer, no matter the reason. But a Prince also knows what sort of creature Reginald Harker was. His appetites, his ambitions.”\nHe begins to pace, slow and deliberate, boots whispering over the marble.🎲 Manipulation + Insight (Difficulty 3) — to gauge whether his words carry genuine compassion or political caution.\n(Rolling automatically.)\n→ 9, 8, 8, 7, 5 → 3 successes ✅You read him well: he’s torn. Adrian isn’t looking for vengeance; he’s calculating the balance between justice and stability. Killing Harker may have solved a problem he didn’t want to name.He stops before you, the lines of his face softening a fraction.\n“Stand up.”\nWhen you obey, he steps closer, lowering his voice so that only you can hear.\n“There will be no public punishment. You will return to the estate. You will close his affairs and keep them closed. You will tell anyone who asks that Reginald Harker met final death by his own folly.”\nHe straightens again, tone firm enough to carry to the chamber’s corners.\n“But you will carry the stain in private, Lucien. Do you understand? You don’t get to forget. That is your penance.”\nHe studies your face a moment longer.\n“You’ve always been an artist. Turn this into art. Make something worthy of the blood you spilled.”\nThen, quieter again:\n“And if anything remains of what he was building… destroy it before someone else tries to finish it.”\nHe turns back toward his chair, signalling that the audience is done.You can respond with a formal oath, promising loyalty and obedience, or risk a personal question—pressing him on what he truly knew of Harker’s work and the Pact. What does Lucien do?At the mention of a penance, Lucian's hand moved to his own neck, the rose tattoo from his imprisonment and the link to the rose beneath the house. Even now he could feel the heart beating so faintly.\"The painting will be my greatest work.\" He said. And then nodded. At the final command to destroy it. Lucian...Wouldn't.He bowed, knelt, kissed the ring of the Prince and vowed his loyalty but in secret. He would not destroy it. He would learn from it. Use it when the Prince needed it the most.Adrian’s ring tastes faintly of old brass and vitae. You stay on one knee until he touches the top of your head — the gesture of pardon, of ownership, of an old friendship reforged into duty.\n“Rise, then,” he says quietly. “And remember this moment. You are not free of me, and I am not free of what you’ve done. We carry it together.”\nHe dismisses you with a flick of his hand. Guards open the heavy doors; the lamps dim behind you as you leave the hall. Outside, the city’s night air feels cleaner, colder. You draw the collar of your coat high, hiding the faint bloom of the tattoo at your neck. Beneath the wool, it pulses once, as if answering a heartbeat a mile below the streets.The ride back to the Harker estate is silent. London slides by in reflections—wet cobbles, gaslight, the shapes of mortals who will never know what moves among them. By the time the carriage stops in the courtyard, the first trace of dawn grays the east.Evelyn waits in the doorway, shawl around her shoulders. When she sees your expression she only asks,\n“He believed you?”\nYou nod.\n“He did. And he gave me a penance.”\nHer eyes drop to the place where the rose burns faintly through your collar. She doesn’t ask what you intend; she’s too old and too wise for that.\n“Then let’s start the painting,” she says. “You’ve always worked best when your hands are busy.”\nWhen you’re alone later in the studio, the canvas looms blank in front of you. You dip the brush, and for the first time the heartbeat beneath the floor merges with the rhythm of your strokes. Each line, each wash of color, carries a whisper from the garden: knowledge, memory, hunger.You’ll keep the secret. You’ll learn what the Pact truly was. And one night, when the Prince’s world begins to crack, you’ll have something no one else does.The rose flares softly against your skin, its pulse settling into time with your own.Chronicle End: “The
