## üïØÔ∏è **Lucien Valemont ‚Äî The Eternal Aesthetic**

**Mortal Life (1850s ‚Äì 1870s)**  
Born in the soot and smog of London‚Äôs East End, Lucien was a servant boy in a manor belonging to **Lord [[Adrien Valemont]]**, an eccentric nobleman known for his scandalous soir√©es and obsession with art, mysticism, and the beautiful decay of the flesh.  
Lucien was quiet, sharp-eyed, and gifted ‚Äî a boy who sketched his masters and their guests by candlelight, capturing their vanity and despair in equal measure.

One night, his sketches were discovered. Instead of punishment, Lucien was summoned. Lord Valemont saw in him something exquisite ‚Äî _a living muse, a sculpture of hunger and grace yet unformed._

**The Embrace**  
The Lord grew infatuated, blurring the lines between patron, artist, and lover. When Lucien reached his twenty-first year, Valemont whispered, _‚ÄúYou are too perfect to fade.‚Äù_  
That night, Lucien died upon satin sheets and awoke into the Requiem ‚Äî reborn by his master‚Äôs hand, not as a man, but as **a masterpiece**.

Valemont shaped him as one might a statue: taught him the arts, the poise, the secrets of blood and brush. Yet like all art, Lucien outgrew his maker. Over decades, he came to see Valemont‚Äôs love as possession ‚Äî beauty caged, desire gilded.

In 1910, during the fire that consumed the Valemont Estate, Lucien disappeared into the night. The ashes of his master were found in the marble gallery, a smile painted upon his lips.

**Modern Nights (Present)**  
Now, Lucien Valemont lives again ‚Äî an immortal aesthete in the modern age, a **‚Äúmodern Rasputin‚Äù** whose salons blur the line between enlightenment and ecstasy.  
His haven, _The Crimson Salon_, is an opulent labyrinth of books, art, and pleasure. Mortals and Kindred alike gather there ‚Äî poets, occultists, models, sinners ‚Äî all drawn to Lucien‚Äôs promise:

> ‚ÄúTo be remembered is to be eternal. Come, and let me paint your soul.‚Äù

He curates his collection of forbidden books and occult tomes, forever chasing the same question that haunted his sire ‚Äî _can art transcend death, or must it consume life to do so?_
