Became his Ghoul in Session 2Age: 24
Mortal Occupation: Postgraduate Literature Student, King’s College London
Background: Born in Bath, raised in a quiet academic family. His father a historian, his mother a painter of modest repute. Adrian grew up in old houses filled with books, portraits, and dust motes — the sort of world where silence itself feels curated.Appearance:
Adrian carries a fragile sort of beauty — pale skin touched by sleeplessness, soft dark hair that never sits quite right, and eyes of deep grey that seem to drink in the world rather than look at it. His clothes are unassuming but thoughtful: charcoal coats, scarves even when not needed, a faint trace of ink on his fingers. His posture is composed yet uncertain, as if he’s still learning how to inhabit his own body.When Lucien first sees him, there’s something familiar about him — the kind of youth Lucien once was: romantic, observant, a little haunted by beauty.Personality:
Curious. Earnest. Too clever for his own good. Adrian is drawn to old things — books that smell of damp paper, poetry that aches with longing, men who carry the weight of centuries in their gaze. Beneath his intellect lies loneliness — a longing to belong somewhere that feels real.He speaks softly, listens intently, and asks questions that unsettle rather than flatter. When he talks about art or literature, it’s with reverence — but when he talks to Lucien, there’s a tremor of awe, as though he senses the predator behind the poet.Connection to Lucien:
Adrian visits The Velvet Veil archive while researching 19th-century vampire symbolism in Romantic literature. Lucien, intrigued by his insight and resemblance to a long-lost muse, begins to feed him knowledge — and eventually, blood. Their connection grows from mentorship to obsession: Adrian sees Lucien as both subject and story, and Lucien sees in Adrian a reflection of the youth he lost.To Lucien, Adrian Vale becomes the living canvas — a fragile mortal touched by art, desire, and the slow corrosion of eternity.]]></description><link>characters/adrian-vale.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Characters/Adrian Vale.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:52:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Velvet Veil]]></title><description><![CDATA[Haven of <a data-href="Lucian Valemont" href="characters/lucian-valemont.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lucian Valemont</a>]]></description><link>locations/the-velvet-veil.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Locations/The Velvet Veil.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:52:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rosethorn Folio]]></title><description><![CDATA[A set of three vellum pages bearing the signatures of long-dead (and still-undead) aristocrats, including <a data-href="Characters/Lucian Valemont" href="characters/lucian-valemont.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Characters/Lucian Valemont</a> own and that of his former master <a data-href="Adrien Valemont" href="characters/adrien-valemont.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Adrien Valemont</a> and headed by <a data-href="Sir Reginald Harker" href="characters/sir-reginald-harker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Reginald Harker</a>.<br><a data-href="The Rosethorn Pact" href="organisations/the-rosethorn-pact.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Rosethorn Pact</a>

The Prince is intrigued, remembering the name Rosethorn from decades past.

Setting: London, modern nightSession Summary<br>The session opened with Lucian awakening in <a data-href="The Velvet Veil" href="locations/the-velvet-veil.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Velvet Veil</a>, hunger gnawing after a sleepless day haunted by memories of the previous night’s encounter with <a data-href="Grimshaw" href="characters/grimshaw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grimshaw</a> and the word Rosethorn. His ghoul, <a data-href="Evelyn" href="characters/evelyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Evelyn</a>, brought him news of a delivery—an intended vessel for his hunger—but Lucian, weary of mind and spirit, refused to feed on a stranger.

Their interaction began as an intellectual exchange on Victorian vampiric myth and ended as a dark reflection of Lucian’s own past, as he revealed himself and fed. The feeding was intimate but controlled, reaffirming his humanity rather than eroding it. The Student, enthralled and awed, became Lucian’s new ghoul, marked with his personal sigil.Afterward, Lucian painted the youth as he slept—an act of creation and sin intertwined—and sealed his hunger in colour and canvas.<br>The following evening, Lucian descended into London’s museum sub-basement, where he met <a data-href="Dr. Sebastian Crowe" href="characters/dr.-sebastian-crowe.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Sebastian Crowe</a>, the Curator of <a data-href="The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum" href="locations/the-victoria-&amp;-albert-museum.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a> and recovered <a data-href="The Rosethorn Folio" href="items/the-rosethorn-folio.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Rosethorn Folio</a>, a set of three vellum pages bearing the signatures of long-dead (and still-undead) aristocrats, including his own and that of his former master, <a data-href="Sir Reginald Harker" href="characters/sir-reginald-harker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Reginald Harker</a>.

The session closed with a meeting between Lucian and Prince Adrien, his oldest friend and the ruler of London’s Kindred.

Mortal Life (1850s – 1870s)<br>
Born in the soot and smog of London’s East End, Lucien was a servant boy in a manor belonging to Lord <a data-href="Adrien Valemont" href="characters/adrien-valemont.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Adrien Valemont</a>, an eccentric nobleman known for his scandalous soirées and obsession with art, mysticism, and the beautiful decay of the flesh.
Lucien was quiet, sharp-eyed, and gifted — a boy who sketched his masters and their guests by candlelight, capturing their vanity and despair in equal measure.One night, his sketches were discovered. Instead of punishment, Lucien was summoned. Lord Valemont saw in him something exquisite — a living muse, a sculpture of hunger and grace yet unformed.The Embrace
The Lord grew infatuated, blurring the lines between patron, artist, and lover. When Lucien reached his twenty-first year, Valemont whispered, “You are too perfect to fade.”
That night, Lucien died upon satin sheets and awoke into the Requiem — reborn by his master’s hand, not as a man, but as a masterpiece.Valemont shaped him as one might a statue: taught him the arts, the poise, the secrets of blood and brush. Yet like all art, Lucien outgrew his maker. Over decades, he came to see Valemont’s love as possession — beauty caged, desire gilded.In 1910, during the fire that consumed the Valemont Estate, Lucien disappeared into the night. The ashes of his master were found in the marble gallery, a smile painted upon his lips.Modern Nights (Present)
Now, Lucien Valemont lives again — an immortal aesthete in the modern age, a “modern Rasputin” whose salons blur the line between enlightenment and ecstasy.
His haven, The Crimson Salon, is an opulent labyrinth of books, art, and pleasure. Mortals and Kindred alike gather there — poets, occultists, models, sinners — all drawn to Lucien’s promise:
“To be remembered is to be eternal. Come, and let me paint your soul.”
He curates his collection of forbidden books and occult tomes, forever chasing the same question that haunted his sire — can art transcend death, or must it consume life to do so?<br><img alt="FVnGuzwX0AAI89x.jpg" src="0.-attachments/fvnguzwx0aai89x.jpg" target="_self"><br>

It rains like it always does — soft, constant, and silver on the windows of Lucian’s unassuming flat in Camden. Beneath the mundane surface lies The Velvet Veil, a hidden chamber of art, relics, and the scent of forgotten roses.Word has reached the Toreador court:
Prince Adrian Welles, the centuries-old ruler of London, is hosting a private salon at his Elysium tonight — ostensibly to unveil a new art installation… but rumor speaks of a power vacuum.The Harpy of London, Marianne of Bath, was found staked in her haven three nights ago. Someone has been feeding the Prince false reports, and suspicion falls on every clan.An invitation, written in expensive cream parchment, rests on Lucian’s piano:
“Your taste and counsel are required, darling Lucian.
— A.”
The venue is the National Gallery, long closed to the public this evening.
Candlelight flickers against oil paintings — Rembrandt, Turner, Rossetti — while Kindred mingle in murmurs and false smiles.Prince Adrian stands near the dais, his pale hand resting on a silver-topped cane.
The Seneschal, a Ventrue named Elodie Rains, approaches you first, her gaze like polished glass.
Elodie: “Lucian. You grace us at last. The Prince will be most eager to hear your… aesthetic insights. But between us — what did Marianne tell you before she perished? You two were… familiar.”
She’s probing. In public. A test of composure and loyalty."My lady Rains.." Lucian made an elegant overexagerated bow, wearing a fine open tunic shirt in the Neuve noir style, open neck and frills. tight leather trousers and knee high boots."It is a heartbreak the moment I heard that Lady Marianne was... you know.." He made a steaking motion into his chest. "First of all, I have not spoken to her in a few months."Elodie Rains watches your performance with an expression that doesn’t quite reach her eyes.
The Seneschal’s lips twitch — not a smile, but the ghost of one. Around you, the chatter of Kindred grows hushed; a few Toreador hang on your words like admirers at a salon performance.
Elodie: “Mm. I see your flair for drama remains intact.”
She takes a step closer, voice a whisper meant for you alone.
“Careful, Lucian. The Prince is… disturbed by her death. And he has already tasked the Hounds with finding her killer. If he suspects your silence hides something, it will not end with words.”
She brushes past, perfume faint and cold. You can feel her intent — she wanted to warn you… or perhaps to see how you react when cornered.At that moment, someone else approaches:
A short man in a dark velvet coat, hair slicked back like oil — Grimshaw, your Nosferatu contact.
He gives a subtle bow, eyes darting toward a quiet corner behind a sculpture of St. Michael.
Grimshaw (low voice):
“Got something for you, Luci. Marianne’s last meeting wasn’t in Whitechapel like everyone says. It was in Knightsbridge.
And she wasn’t with a Brujah — she was meeting someone from Elysium.”
He pauses, a grin splitting his sallow face.
“Guess who.”
Lucian looks a little offended at Elodie as he puts his hand on his chest. "My lady, you wound me with those accusations. I am a loyal servent of the Prince and the Camarilla since my introduction all those years ago. I have done nothing but be honest and open with all who come to me and those who summon me." He nodded softly.Turning to Grimshaw, Lucian nodded and motioned. "As you see, I have pulled favours to find out what had happened, Although Whitechapel is a horrible place, Knightsbridge even more so..." He turned to the contact. "Who?"Lovely—Lucian’s injured dignity plays like music through the hall. The surrounding Kindred murmur with subtle appreciation; even Elodie seems momentarily disarmed by his gallant tone. She offers only a curt nod before drifting off to attend to another guest.Now the spotlight narrows to you and Grimshaw, tucked behind the sculpture’s marble wings. The low buzz of the salon becomes a distant hum, the scent of candlewax and aged wine hanging between you.Grimshaw’s eyes dart left and right before he speaks, his voice a conspiratorial rasp.
Grimshaw: “Marianne met with Sir Reginald Harker. You know him—Keeper of Elysium, Toreador like yourself, all white gloves and quiet cruelty. The Prince trusts him more than anyone. Or used to.”
He produces a thin, leather-bound notebook, small enough to hide in a sleeve. The edges are stained with something dark.
“Found this in Marianne’s haven. Mentions The Rosethorn Pact. Don’t know what that is yet, but whatever she learned got her killed.”
He glances toward the Prince’s dais.
“You tell Welles, and he’ll tear Elysium apart looking for scapegoats. You tell Harker, and he’ll bury you under a dozen compliments and call it art. My advice? Keep your head low until you know which one’s the spider.”
He pauses, half-grinning.
“Unless you’re feeling brave, Luci.”
"Well dont you have my balls in a vice my little impish friend." he sighed, running his hand down his face, before approaching the Prince, more pomp and elegance as he bowedLucian’s boots click softly on the marble as he strides through the candlelit gallery. The gathered Kindred part like curtains, watching with a mix of envy and dread as he approaches the dais.Prince Adrian Welles stands before Turner’s “The Fighting Temeraire”, the faint glow of its golden horizon reflected in his pale eyes. A beautiful corpse admiring another. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle — too gentle.
Welles: “Lucian. The rose among brambles.”
He turns, a faint smile ghosting his lips.
“Marianne’s death wounds us all. You were close to her. Tell me… do you mourn her as I do?”
He gestures for you to rise. The Seneschal, Elodie, lingers just out of earshot — clearly watching.Now is your moment. You can present the notebook and shape the narrative."She will be missed, my Prince. I was fond of her, she had an air and perfume that I much enjoyed being around. Plus, her tits were to die for." He chuckled softly to himself."I... I am torn my Prince. A contact of mine whom I sent to investigate upon hearing the act, found something that would put me at a disadvantage to all sides. I fear for my safety, not from you my Prince, you are as ever, a graceful and honrouable patron.. " He bowed again. "But I am fearful of those who did this to our dearest Marianne. If I may, I wish to approach and bring this to your attention, without the prying eyes of those around."The humor cuts through the tension like a fine edge — daring, irreverent, Toreador to the bone.
The Prince’s expression doesn’t change at first, but a corner of his mouth betrays the faintest ghost of amusement. A ripple of whispers passes through the court — Lucian always did dance on knives.Welles raises a pale hand, and immediately, the chatter dies. The room grows so silent you can hear the rain tapping against the gallery’s grand windows.
Welles: “Very well, Lucian. Let us step aside.”
His voice is soft but heavy, carrying the kind of command that brooks no refusal.
He gestures toward a curtained alcove — a private annex lined with portraits of mortal nobles long dead. Once inside, the velvet curtains close behind you, muting the outside world. The Prince turns, his eyes sharp now, the veneer of charm fading into something ancient.
Welles: “Show me.”
You remove the notebook, holding it delicately as if it might crumble. Its worn leather glints in the flickering light.The Prince accepts it carefully, opening to the page marked by a torn ribbon — The Rosethorn Pact. His brows knit slightly.
Welles: “This… name. I have not heard it in decades.”
He looks up, meeting your gaze.
“You were wise to bring this to me. But tell me — who gave you this?”
You feel the weight of the question. His voice is calm, but there’s an edge, like the hush before a predator’s lunge. Grimshaw’s name burns at the back of your throat — valuable, but dangerous."A contact of mine found it in her belongings.. He is, well.. not one for the glamour of the light. If you catch my drift..."Welles studies you for several long seconds. The candlelight catches his eyes — ancient, cold, and strangely… amused.
Welles: “Ah. The shadows speak to you, then.”
He closes the notebook slowly, fingers tapping its cover as if testing the rhythm of a waltz.
“That pleases me. The Camarilla needs those who listen to whispers, not those who shout them.”
He takes a half-step closer, lowering his voice to something confidential — almost intimate.
Welles: “You have done well, Lucian. If this Rosethorn Pact stirs again, I want you to be my eyes and my voice in that dark. Bring me what you find. Quietly.”
“In return…” he glances toward the curtain, where Elodie waits like a statue, “…I will see that you are protected from whatever wolves stalk this court.”
He places the notebook into his coat. The moment feels sealed, heavy with unseen consequence.Then, with the faintest smile:
Welles: “Tell me, my rose — do you trust Sir Reginald Harker?”
You realize this is not idle curiosity. The Prince is measuring you.
He knows you’ve already considered the possibility.This is the pivotal point — your words will shape how Welles moves next: whether Harker becomes an ally, an enemy, or a target.He pauses, thinking for a moment."I have not had the pleasure of his courtie but I have heard about him. And the rumours in the circles of his actions. I honestly have no opinion on him as of yet my Prince."Welles regards you for a long moment, his stillness unnerving. Then, slowly, the Prince’s expression softens — the faintest curl of a satisfied smile.
Welles: “Spoken like a true servant of the Camarilla. A man of reason amid a sea of passion.”
He steps closer, lowering his tone so only you can hear.
“Hold to that composure, Lucian. The nights ahead will tempt you to passion — and in passion, the Toreador are at their weakest.”
He reaches into his coat and produces a small, folded card of thick, cream parchment. The Prince’s personal seal — black wax embossed with a rose and crown.
Welles: “Take this. Present it to my Herald should you require sanctuary, or should anyone question your place in this court. You have done me a service tonight.”
He looks toward the curtain.
“Now go, my rose. Enjoy the music. And keep your eyes open. Harker will not rest easy when he learns his name passed through your lips — even so gently.”
With that, he turns away, leaving you with the faint scent of sandalwood and old paper.Back in the main hall, the atmosphere has shifted — murmurs ripple through the gathered Kindred. You notice Sir Reginald Harker himself standing by the piano, surrounded by lesser Toreador. He raises a glass of dark vitae toward you, a sly smile touching his lips.You’ve barely taken three steps when Grimshaw sidles back up beside you, whispering low:
Grimshaw: “You did it, didn’t you? Whatever you said, the Prince’s pet ghoul just left Elysium in a hurry. Looks like someone’s about to get visited.”
He smirks. “So, what now, Luci? You going to let the old man’s hounds handle it, or dig deeper yourself before the trail’s cold?”
Taking his hand as the card is handed, Lucian kisses it gently; a loving kiss. A submissive kiss. One that had been shared many years ago on warm nights with a fledgling soon to be Prince and the artist before him."Yes my Prince. "returning, he takes a glass of blood and downs it in one, not able to even take the time to savour it. Raising the empty glass to Sir Reginald.Looking to grimshaw, he sighs."I'm going to do what my Prince requires. I am going into the den of lions as a little lamb. I know sir Reginald has a thing for those of my... appearance and virvor.. We will bed, and we will talk against the pillow, as all do."Grimshaw huffs out a low, wet laugh — the sound of a gutter-born man genuinely impressed.
Grimshaw: “You mad, shining bastard. You’re going to let the spider wrap you up and call it art.”
He glances around, lowers his voice. “Fine. I’ll keep an ear to the sewers. If the hounds start sniffin’ too close, I’ll send word. You just… don’t get eaten.”
He melts back into the crowd, swallowed by marble and shadow.You make your way across the gallery. Harker is waiting — immaculate as a statue, one hand resting on a cane that’s more ornament than support. His gaze follows you, appreciative in the way collectors study paintings they already own.
Harker: “Lucian. The Prince’s favorite pet graces my corner.
You’ve been avoiding me, haven’t you? I do hope it’s not fear.”
He steps closer, voice dropping to a purr.
Harker: “You look… exquisite tonight. Come — drink with me. I insist.”
He gestures toward a secluded lounge where the candles burn lower and the whispers sound like sighs. The table glitters with crystal and silver, and the air smells faintly of rosewater and blood.You sit. The dance begins.Harker leans forward, eyes glittering.
Harker: “They say you brought something interesting to our Prince.
You wouldn’t happen to know what that might be, would you?”
He smiles, thin and knowing — the smile of a man who already suspects, and is waiting to see how gracefully you lie."No far at all My Lord Sire." Lucian bows and curtsies. Taking his hand and kissing it softly."I've just been so gathered with so much work in the painters alley that I've been unable to be torn away from the muses." He chuckled softly. The tone, the voice, the purr, the sly hand slipped down the back of his trousers to prod his opening with a single finger..Intent, he all but knew."Ofcourse my lord sire.. I wouldn't think of anything I'd want to do more." He gasped softly, following him into the lounge and sitting beside him.Leg crossed, one hanging over Harker's leg, Lucian pressed up against Harker, he spoke softly, playing with the older's hair with an eblow on the sofa back behind him."There was the death of one of a close friends of ours... he asked if I knew anything. An old contact of mine brought me a letter he found, to some Nosferatu working for the Anarchists..." He lied, half lied."The Prince is going to search there way." He sighed, a needy husky submissive sigh as he sipped the blood in the wine glassThe lounge feels smaller than it is. The air is perfumed with dust, velvet, and vitae. Harker allows the nearness — even encourages it — a faint smirk curling his mouth as Lucian’s charm bleeds into the moment. For the Toreador, proximity is conversation; the body is punctuation.
Harker: “Ah… the muses. They are such jealous lovers.”
His fingers trace the rim of his glass.
“You do them justice, Lucian. Even your lies are painted beautifully.”
He tilts his head, eyes narrowing in faint amusement.
Harker: “So the Prince sends his hounds to the sewers. Convenient. Keeps his gaze away from the gallery, doesn’t it?”
A pause. The mask slips — just a flicker, but Lucian sees it: the tiniest tightening of the jaw, a ripple of irritation that he hides behind a smile.
Harker: “Tell me, my dear, did your… contact happen to mention what this letter said? Or did you leave that part out to make me chase it from your lips?”
The question is bait. You can feel it. He’s not sure what you know — but he’s fishing, testing whether the Prince told you anything real.
The wine-dark candlelight glints across his signet ring — engraved with a thorned rose.With their lips almost close, faces so close as if to kiss, but not... The two sat there, Lucian pressed against him like a good submissive toy."I did not read it. The Prince's dog summoned me. I dont get involved in the court's dealings. I am just an archivist, collector, painter and... lover.."The line lands softly, but it hits its mark.
Harker’s eyes stay on yours a long moment — weighing, measuring, wondering whether to believe the meekness or enjoy it. He lets the pause stretch until it hums.
Harker: “A lover… and yet, you find yourself in the centre of a Prince’s investigation.”
He smiles faintly. “That, my dear Lucian, is why I adore artists. You pretend not to play the game, and still, you always end up on the stage.”
He straightens, the air cooling between you. The mask returns, voice smooth once more.
Harker: “Keep to your paints for now. If His Grace asks, tell him that I am as loyal as ever. You may even tell him I toasted to Marianne’s memory tonight.”
His smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “And if the Rosethorn nonsense resurfaces again, come to me first. We mustn’t trouble the Prince with rumours.”
He stands, adjusts his cuffs, then glances back down at you.
Harker: “You wear obedience beautifully, Lucian. But remember—submission can be a kind of art, too. Practise it wisely.”
He leaves you in the low light, the sound of the chamber orchestra drifting faintly from the gallery beyond.
On the table beside his half-empty glass lies something he must have meant you to notice: a small pressed rose, its petals darkened to near black and pricked through with a silver pin.Grimshaw appears a few minutes later, lurking in the doorway, eyes darting between you and the abandoned flower.
Grimshaw: “Well? You live. That’s somethin’. What’s that he left ya?”
Hearing the Rosethorn word, he almost coughed at it, but kept his face submissivly passive."Ofcourse.. my lord sire.." He said softly, slowly sliding down the sofa until he was on his knee's between the Lord's legs. A sharp nailed hand running through his silvery white hair.Fade to blackAfter Harker had left the alchove; Lucian sprawled on the leather sofa in the quiet slcohove, Using a paper fan to cool himself down, "Shut up you disgusting rat." Lucian's mask dropped for once. He picked up the glass rose, inspecting it close as he pinned it to his lapel."Its a whore bitches collar. To tell the world who's bitch I am." He growled. "What do you want.."You can almost hear the gallery again now that Harker’s presence is gone—the faint scrape of a bow across strings, the hush of other conversations resuming once the Prince’s Keeper has taken his leave.Grimshaw steps a little further inside. He’s still smiling, but it’s the kind of grin that hides nerves rather than delight.
Grimshaw: “Easy, Luci. You still got both eyes and a heartbeat—undead as it is. That’s a win in my book.”
He gestures with a stubby finger toward the pinned rose.
Grimshaw: “That thing’s got teeth, though. You feel it? There’s a symbol etched on the pin—tiny, under the clasp. Old sigil the Nosferatu trade around; it means property of the Rosethorn. Marianne had one in her haven too, same metal. Whoever wears it’s marked as belonging to the Pact, or claimed by it.”
He crouches beside the couch, voice dropping lower.
Grimshaw: “You just got drafted into their little club, whether you like it or not. Question is: you gonna wear the leash and see where it leads, or cut it off before they start tugging?”
He straightens, waiting, his expression halfway between admiration and worry."The man just fucked me, used me and told me in no uncertain terms I'm his bitch, and that he is involved. THIS is exactly what you said it is. And its not your business to know what I do with it." He growled. "And you'll probably sell this information to anyone who asks or pays you enough." He sighed, standing up, pulling up his trousers and fastening his belt, brushing his fingers through his hair and checking his stained self in the reflection of a nearby picture frame."The Prince was a brother to me, a lover, one of my closest companions. I serve him, but this.." He flicked the rose. "Is all part of serving my Prince. I have to play both sides."Grimshaw lifts both hands, palms out, the smirk fading.
Grimshaw: “Easy, easy. You don’t owe me your soul, Luci. You’re right—I deal in whispers, not faith. But I ain’t stupid enough to sell a rumour that’s got the Prince and Harker both stitched into it.”
He waits while you straighten yourself, eyes flicking toward the curtained doorway.
Grimshaw: “All right. You play the pretty pawn. Just remember pawns bleed first when the board flips.”
He hesitates, then adds quietly:
Grimshaw: “If you need to pass something to Welles without anyone seein’ you together, leave it at the old tube station in Camden Town. The one they never reopened after the Blitz. I’ll make sure it reaches him.”
He melts back toward the shadows, voice dropping to a rasp.
Grimshaw: “Watch Harker’s temper. The man collects people the way you collect paintings. And when he gets bored…”
The rest is lost in the din of the gallery as he disappears.Lucian is alone again. The faint strings of the orchestra drift through the curtains. Outside this little alcove, the Elysium’s glittering court has resumed its dance—none of them yet realising that the game has changed.The rose on your lapel catches the light, a small glint of silver and black.You’ve gained:
The Prince’s favour — protection and access.
Harker’s mark — leverage and danger.
Grimshaw’s channel — a way to move in the dark unseen.
He threw the empty glass at the cloth curtain covering the door to get Grimshaw to leave.With a sigh, he goes home.The glass hits the curtain with a sharp, hollow clink, rolls across the marble, and disappears into the folds. The sound is enough; you hear Grimshaw’s boots scuff once, then fade completely.Outside, London’s rain has turned from mist to a steady downpour.
The streets are slick mirrors of sodium light. By the time Lucian reaches his building in Camden, the night smells of wet stone and paint thinner — the scent of his own exile.Inside, The Velvet Veil waits just as he left it: canvases leaning against walls, half-finished studies of faces he can’t quite forget. The only sound is the soft ticking of an antique clock and the occasional sigh of pipes behind the plaster.He peels off the damp shirt, hangs the coat where it always hangs. The rose glints faintly in the mirror, the tiny silver pin catching the room’s lone bulb. A reminder. A claim.For a moment, Lucian’s reflection looks like the boy who once knelt before a fledgling artist turned Prince, full of hope and devotion. Then the illusion breaks, leaving only the pale creature with too many debts and not enough time to pay them.He pours himself another glass, this time not pretending to taste it.
The city hums below — its heartbeat slow and secret.
Allies: Prince Adrian Welles — trusts you, for now. You hold his personal seal.
Grimshaw (Nosferatu) — wary ally, courier of secrets. Enemies / Dangers: Sir Reginald Harker — Keeper of Elysium, probable member of the Rosethorn Pact. Has “marked” you as his.
The Rosethorn Pact — unknown purpose, tied to Marianne’s death. Current Status: You are walking a double line between the Prince and Harker.
The mark makes you both protected and exposed.
Knightsbridge remains the last confirmed site connected to the Pact. ]]></description><link>gpt-vtm/exported-text/chatgpt-vtm-v5-session-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">GPT VTM/Exported Text/ChatGPT-VTM V5 session 1.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:22:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ChatGPT-VTM V5 session 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[User: Lewis Stockton (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:lewisstocktonnovelist@gmail.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="mailto:lewisstocktonnovelist@gmail.com" target="_self">lewisstocktonnovelist@gmail.com</a>)

Before we start — let’s quickly align so I can set the tone right.Can you confirm these details for me:
Which character(s) you’re playing this session? (Lucien Valemont, or others?)
Where we left off — last I saw, Lucien had just left after that tense scene with Grimshaw and the mention of the Rosethorn and the Prince. Do you want to pick up immediately after that, or skip ahead (e.g., to his haven or next night)?
Are we keeping this in the same chronicle continuity — the Velvet Veil haven, the Prince, Grimshaw, etc.?
Once I’ve got that, I’ll set the scene and we’ll dive straight into Session 2.I'm Lucian. Also when doing the responses. Leave it open for me to do my actions. Don't suggest actions. And don't take thr plot too far. We need to go.deeper not wider in scopeWe skip to the next night using the rules of the tabletopPerfect — understood completely.
I’ll handle narration, NPC dialogue, and environment only.
You’ll handle Lucien’s thoughts, words, and actions.
I’ll move time using V5 structure: End of night → Hunger roll → Rouse checks → New night begins.
We’ll keep this tight, focused, and deep in tone and character.Session 2: The Night AfterThe world turns dark again.
The sun dies over London, and the city exhales smoke, perfume, and sin.
Lucien Valemont stirs.
Before we begin, we perform the Rouse Check for awakening.Roll one die (or I can roll it for you):
Success (6+) → You do not gain Hunger.
Fail (1–5) → You gain +1 Hunger.
Would you like me to roll for you, or do you want to roll your own?So the rollAlright — rolling one die for Lucien’s Rouse Check as he awakens… 🎲Result: 4That’s a fail — you awaken hungrier than before.
Hunger increases by +1.
The Velvet Veil is silent when your eyes open.
Velvet curtains hang heavy, the faint scent of blood and old wine mingling in the still air.
Somewhere beyond the walls, the muffled hum of London nightlife seeps through — laughter, sirens, the pulse of the city.Your phone, resting on the antique vanity, blinks once. A message received just moments ago.Would you like to check it? Or attend to something else first?With a sigh. Lucian woke. Tires. Hungry. He'd not fed when he got home, the thoughts, memories and act with the man raged in his mind.Sitting in the edge of his bed. He rubbed his face. One of his servants should be about. Not a real servant but a ghoul he protected and was part of his littke inner circle.Pressing the phone button, he stood up and stretchedThe screen’s glow paints the room in cold blue light.1 New Message — from: Evelyn
“Good evening, sir. I’ve brought what you asked for. She’s downstairs in the parlor. Breathing, clean, and terrified. Shall I send her up?”
You can hear faint footsteps somewhere below, the creak of floorboards near the stairwell — the rhythm of the living pacing nervously.The hunger inside stirs, whispering against restraint.
Even the stretch of your limbs feels slow, deliberate, predatory.The room remains still — velvet curtains drawn tight, candlelight guttering in the reflection of a gilded mirror.What does Lucien do?He clicked the speaker button. "Who. What? Why?" He groanedThere’s a short pause — then Evelyn’s voice comes through the tinny speaker, her tone careful, measured, deferential.
“You said last week, sir… to keep one on hand. For when you wake like this.”
“A dancer from one of the clubs you like. No drugs, no disease. I screened her myself.”
A faint sound of movement filters through the phone — Evelyn lowering her voice.
“She doesn’t know what you are. Just thinks it’s a private appointment. Shall I bring her up, or… dispose of her?”
The words dispose of hang heavy, like perfume in still air.
Somewhere in the hallway outside, the soft hum of the building continues — life, waiting.What does Lucien say?"Tell her I am sorry she was disturbed. Give her money and a call a cab for her. Pay for it." He sighed.You can almost hear Evelyn hesitate before replying — a soft intake of breath, a whisper caught between obedience and concern.
“...Understood, sir.”
A pause. Then, quieter, with that faint tremor of familiarity only a ghoul who’s seen too much would dare show:
“You should feed soon, Lucien. You know what happens if you wait too long.”
The line clicks dead.Below, faint footsteps move across the wooden floor, a murmured conversation, the sound of a door opening and closing — then the low rumble of a cab engine outside fading into the distance.The Velvet Veil is silent again. Only you and the echo of your own restraint remain.The hunger gnaws — it’s not unbearable yet, but the beast in you stirs, restless and listening.A moment later, a soft knock on your chamber door. Evelyn’s voice, subdued but professional:
“She’s gone. Coffee’s on your desk. Synthetic. I thought it might help.”
What does Lucien do?(Don't keep asking what I do)"Thank you eve.. I'm.. I'm sorry. It was a horrible session in court. I am drained.. muse and physically"The door opens a fraction — just enough for Evelyn to slip in. She’s dressed in her usual sharp, understated black, a silver chain glinting faintly against her throat — the one you gave her, long ago.She sets the steaming cup down on your desk without a word, her expression softening as she studies you.
“You don’t need to explain, sir.”
“You come back from those meetings looking like death itself — more than usual.”
Her attempt at humor dies halfway out of her mouth. She folds her hands in front of her, eyes lowered.
“Do you want me to cancel the curator’s appointment tomorrow? The one about the Rosethorn piece?”
Her tone is light, but the name carries weight — unspoken implications between you both.He looked up quickly. "The what?" He stood up, right in her face all.of a sudden. "What did you say?"Evelyn stiffens as your movement cuts through the air — her pulse audibly quickens, a flutter beneath the scent of perfume and fear. She doesn’t step back, but her voice lowers.
“The Rosethorn, sir. The curator from the British Museum—he said you’d arranged to meet about an acquisition, some manuscript fragment connected to it. He confirmed it yesterday. I thought you knew.”
Her throat moves as she swallows, trying to hold your gaze.
“Should I… tell him you’re indisposed?”
The word Rosethorn seems to hang in the air now — almost alive, like a whispered invocation that stirs the Beast just behind your ribs. The hunger sharpens, curious, remembering last night’s whispered name."No.. no.. I need to go to it." He sighed. "I need a bath. I smell like a whore." He complained.Evelyn lets out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding. The tension softens from her shoulders, replaced with quiet efficiency.
“I’ll draw one for you.”
She moves to the adjoining washroom. Soon, the sound of running water fills the suite — a steady, calming rush. The faint scent of rose oil and sandalwood drifts out, mingling with the dust and candlelight of your chamber.After a few minutes, she returns, wiping her hands on a cloth.
“It’s ready. Towels are warm. I’ll lay out something appropriate for tomorrow—dark, understated, nothing that draws attention.”
She pauses, eyes flicking over you, worry creeping in around her usual composure.
“Lucien… are you sure you want to go back into that circle again? After last night?”
Her tone carries something dangerously close to fear for you.He was now naked and stood looking out the high floor to ceiling window."I'm already in that circle. I need to figure out what this Rosethorn is.. why the lord needs it and why it got my friend killed." He said softly."Come here.. " He held out his hand and embraced her in a soft hug as he stood behind her, looking outside."This place.. this city.. is okd. Far older than I am. And it's full of much.more dangerous things.. but I will protect you. I will never hurt you. Even if I get angry. I will never hurt you.," he said
Holding her gently. His face right by her neckEvelyn stays very still for a moment; her breath hitches once and then slows. She doesn’t pull away, but she’s careful not to lean into you either. The scent of her skin and the trace of heartbeat so close make the hunger ache against your ribs.
“You’ve said that before,” she murmurs, not accusing—just remembering. “And you’ve kept it.”
Outside the window, the city is a living constellation: amber streetlamps, river mist, the red eyes of aircraft circling Heathrow. The hum of London carries faintly through the glass, distant and eternal.After a quiet stretch she speaks again, voice low:
“Then find out, Lucien. Whatever the Rosethorn is, don’t let it take more of you than it already has.”
The bath water ripples in the next room, steam curling through the doorway like breath."I would like to feed." He said softly. "Not gutter whores like that girl.. someone.. pristine.. perfect.. "Evelyn nods slowly, eyes still fixed on the city’s reflection in the glass. Her voice is careful, professional, but not cold.
“Then we’ll do it properly. I can reach out to one of your usual donors — the ones who know what they’re offering. A hospital intern, perhaps, or one of the club regulars who crave the mark.”
She hesitates before adding, quieter:
“You’re at Hunger Two now, I can tell. Don’t wait until it’s worse. You start seeing them differently when you do.”
She steps away from your arms gently, heading toward the desk where her ledger rests. The faint scratch of her pen accompanies her words.
“Who should I call tonight, Lucien? The student from Whitechapel… or the violinist from Soho?”
He'd meant her.. he wanted to feed on her.. but would not force her."The student. He was young. Virile.. kept me alert.. smart too.. kept me.. satisfied." He smirked as his lower limb twitched briefly at the thoughtEvelyn glances up at the tone, catching the meaning that lingers behind your words.
Her eyes soften a little—an old understanding that doesn’t need spelling out—and she gives a single nod.
“I’ll message him. He usually answers quickly.”
The tapping of keys follows, brief and precise.
“He’ll come after his night lecture, about an hour. I’ll have him wait in the library downstairs when he arrives.”
She closes the phone, sets it down, and moves toward the washroom door. The bathwater glistens under candlelight, steam tracing the edges of the marble tub.
“You’ve got time to wash off the day before he gets here.”
The water sounds inviting now, the warmth promising to drown out the cold that comes with the Beast’s restlessness.
Evelyn leaves the door open as she goes to prepare the room below.He goes and bathes. Giving himself satisfaction in thr bath. Physically. Before dressing and going a out his night. All ready for thr next night. Preparing a pistol and a stiletto daggerSteam and hot water take the night from your skin like a slow confession. The bath swallows the grime of the court — powder, sweat, the scent of someone else’s cologne — and for a time the city and its rot feel distant, muffled by tile and steam. Your hands find what they need; the pleasure is practiced and private, a ritual that steadies the edges of the hunger without undoing what you are.When you step out the mirror gives back a man composed: dark suit waiting on the chaise, shirt pressed, collar soft. You sheathe the stiletto where it can be reached without thought and tuck the small pistol into the shoulder rig you've had modified. Metals whisper under cloth; the weight is familiar, a sentence read aloud.Evelyn leaves the library lights low and the hearth banked. A single envelope sits on the writing desk — the curator’s card tucked inside, stamped with a meeting time for tomorrow and the word Rosethorn underlined twice. A small folded note from her: Student is on his way. He’ll wait in the stacks. I’ll leave the back stair unlocked.Rain begins to smear the city into silver. Through the tall windows the Thames hides itself behind a curtain of motion; a cab hisses past below. The hour presses forward — soon the young man will climb your steps, innocent, alert, an offering you chose carefully.Hunger: 2. The Beast hums, patient for now but attentive. The night is primed: a donor waiting in the library, the curator’s summons looming, and the name Rosethorn threaded through the edges of your waking.You leave the suite and the steam behind, the hallway swallowing your footsteps. The library waits, books breathing dust and secrets. The lamp by the librarian’s table throws a small island of amber into the dark. A single knock — or perhaps a soft step on the back stair — will split the quiet.The scene is yours.Stepping into the library, Lucian runs his fingers down the spines. Taking in the smells, the feeling.. the taste of the old books in the air.The library breathes around you, Lucien — oak, vellum, the faint bite of ink gone dry centuries ago. Dust motes drift through the lamplight like lazy constellations.Your fingers trail the shelves — smooth leather, cracked parchment, gilt lettering fading under touch.
Each volume murmurs its own small prayer of decay: a choir of forgotten voices whispering just for you.Somewhere deeper in the room, footsteps pause. The door from the servant’s stair creaks open.
A young man stands half-lit in the archway — the student. His eyes search the dim space before finding you.He’s tall, lean beneath his wool coat, hair tousled from rain. A small notebook protrudes from his pocket, and when he speaks, his tone carries both curiosity and deference.
“Mr. Valemont? Ms. Evelyn said you wanted to see me. I—I hope I’m not too late.”
He closes the door gently behind him, glancing around the shelves with the awkward reverence of someone stepping into a cathedral.Turning. He smiles. Baring his teeth in a welcoming seductive way."Not at all my friend. Come.. we have a great evening planned and I hope to shower you with as much fun as you are willing to embrace.. "The student relaxes a little at the warmth in your tone, rain still glistening in his hair. He steps forward, the faint scent of damp paper and cheap aftershave following him.
“That sounds… wonderful, sir.”
He sets his satchel on a nearby chair, eyes darting over the shelves and the candlelight.
“Every time I come here, it feels like I’m walking into another century.”
He laughs softly, uncertain but eager to please. His pulse beats fast, bright against the hush of the library — the kind of rhythm that pulls the attention of your senses even when you try not to listen.He takes another step closer.
“So, what did you want to talk about this time? The manuscript you mentioned before?”
The space between you is only a few feet now, his voice low, curious, unaware."This library is even older than I am." He said. Not letting his nature revealed but playing on the notion that everyone said he was older than he looks."And it's Lucian, you don't have to call me sir, unless you'd rather become my subservient submissive and breedable slave. Then it's Master.." He teased, a gentle caress of the lads cheek and chin with two long nailed fingers."Ah yes. The manuscript you wanted to see. I have to in a special case in the private viewing rooms.."Let’s pause a moment before we continue.
I can describe what happens next and keep the atmosphere between them charged and mysterious, but I can’t include or imply explicit sexual activity or coercion.If you’d like, we can play this scene with Lucien’s predatory charm and hunger as the focus — the tension of being close to someone who doesn’t realise how dangerous he really is, and the ritual of feeding itself, described tastefully through sensation and control rather than explicit detail.Would you like me to continue in that direction?Ifs not explicit sexual activity or coercion. He's being predatory and playful and drawing him in for maybe revealing who he Is and a willing feedGot it — I’ll keep the tone predatory, intimate, and Gothic without crossing the line.The student shivers under your touch, not out of fear but out of the thrill that seems to come with being noticed by you. His mouth opens as if to answer your teasing, but the words falter, caught somewhere between laughter and breath.
“Lucien then…” he murmurs, eyes flicking briefly to your hand, “but you do have a way of making that sound dangerous.”
The flicker of candlelight catches in his eyes as you gesture toward the rear of the library. The air grows cooler there, the old stone walls swallowing the sound of your footsteps. The private viewing room is small, paneled in dark wood and lined with glass cases. The faint scent of old paper and something sweeter — blood remembered, perhaps — lingers within.The student lingers just inside the doorway, curiosity outweighing caution.
“You keep all this to yourself? It’s beautiful… and a little haunting.”
He smiles faintly, looking to you for permission to step closer."Knowledge is power. Especially dangerous knowledge like this. Tell me. Why are you interested in the mythos of Vampires of victorian era?"The young man steps closer to the glass case, fingertips hovering just above it as though the parchment inside might crumble at a breath.
He glances toward you with a half-smile that’s equal parts shyness and fascination.
“I think it’s the idea of them,” he says softly. “Something elegant, tragic… people who live forever but spend that eternity trapped in their own hunger. It’s romantic and awful at the same time.”
He tilts his head, studying the script inside the case, then you.
“You’d have fit right into those stories, you know. The way you talk about the past—like you were there.”
The candle flame wavers, throwing your reflection beside his in the glass; two figures blurred together in amber light.
Outside the door the house is quiet, the only sound the rain whispering against the windows."Maybe I would.. " He smirked. Lifting the glass case away."What would you do if they were real? What would you say to them?" He asked. Standing close behind, almost pressed against him and breathing over his shoulder. Arms wrapped under the lads arms and turning a pageThe young man doesn’t flinch; he exhales slowly, eyes tracing the inked page while your breath ghosts against his ear.
A faint tremor runs through him—fear, excitement, maybe both.
“I’d… ask them what it costs,” he says after a moment. “All that time. All that power. If it’s worth the price.”
He turns his head slightly, just enough that he can see you in the edge of his vision. The candlelight picks out the lines of his throat, the pulse just below the skin.
“And then,” he adds, voice barely above a whisper, “I’d ask if they’d show me.”
The paper between your fingers crackles softly as the Beast stirs, listening."It.. is." He said. Answering the first question. "And I could. But it would be a path you could never step off. You'd be a slave to desire, a slave to your emotions.. you'd be my son. In blood and in subservience." He said softly warmly. Revealing himself as he wrapped hid arms around his waist.Loving. Yet.. restraining. Not letting him go if he panicked.He stills in your arms, the first sharp intake of breath giving way to a quiet tremor. For a heartbeat he’s caught between disbelief and the logic that tells him to laugh it off. When he doesn’t find any humour in your eyes, something changes in his.
“You’re serious…”
His voice is thin, almost reverent. He doesn’t struggle; he just stands there, pulse beating quick and bright beneath your fingertips. The warmth of him is close enough to make your restraint ache.
“Then it’s real,” he whispers. “You’re real.”
You can feel the decision forming in him, a sort of surrender born from curiosity rather than fear. He turns his head slightly, offering a glimpse of throat and the faintest nod—permission, or at least acceptance—without words.The library is utterly still. Only the rain keeps time against the glass."As real as the blood calling to me in your Veins.. turn to page 85.." He instructed.There, a painting. Of a victorian noble thought to be a vampire. Thr scene depicting a blood orgy of nobles.In the middle of it all. A young fellow who looked exactly like Lucian."My first blood orgy.. I was naive. Used and spent. Best night of my life.. "The student stares at the page for a long moment, his hand trembling slightly as he traces the outline of the painted face — your face — rendered in oils a century and a half ago. The likeness is too exact to dismiss as coincidence: the same eyes, the same mouth curved just so in amusement or hunger.He swallows.
“That can’t be… that’s you.”
His voice is barely a whisper, half awe, half horror. The colors on the page seem to bleed under the candlelight; the artist’s brushwork captures movement, skin, teeth, and ecstasy in strokes that look almost wet.
“How long have you been…”
He trails off, unable to find the word. The smell of old varnish and warm blood in his veins fills the space between you; he’s no longer pulling away, but he’s not entirely calm either—suspended between fascination and the slow, creeping understanding that he’s standing inside one of the stories he used to read.The room feels smaller, the shelves leaning inward like witnesses."A long time.. I was taken against my will. My lord.. he was a cruel but loving man. If you want to become all that you yearn for.. I can give it to you.. but you must serve me.. as I served him. Body, mind, soul" he instructed."One day you'll join in the embrace and I will make you mine.. but for now..I ask you to pledge to me.."He stands very still, eyes still on the painting, breath trembling just once before he answers.
“You make it sound like a vow,” he says quietly.
He looks back at you now, trying to read your expression, to separate threat from promise. There’s no mockery left in his voice; only the weight of someone who knows the moment matters.
“If I say yes… what does that mean tonight? What do I do?”
He’s searching for the line between ritual and danger, waiting for you to define it."A vow that means death if you fail.. death for you and me.." He said. Speaking over his shoulder.. And started to kiss at his neck."We will make love.. and I will show you my sanctum. Where we will make art together.. tonight.. if you accept.. "I can’t include or describe sexual activity or anything that implies it.
If you’d like to keep going, we can frame the scene around the vow and the feeding instead—the moment when Lucien seals a bond with the student, mingling intimacy and danger through the act of drinking, without crossing that line.Would you like to continue in that direction?(It's not sexual. He's telling him what will happen later which will be a cut to black)Understood — I’ll keep it implicit and fade to the threshold of that moment.The young man swallows again, eyes half-closed as your words pour against his skin. You can feel the heartbeat quicken under your mouth, each pulse like a drum calling you closer to what you are.
“Then I accept,” he whispers. “Whatever this vow means… I’m yours.”
The library seems to hold its breath. The air thickens, charged, the candle’s flame drawn long and thin. When your fangs pierce skin, the first taste is copper and warmth and life — a ribbon of vitality winding through the centuries. The student’s body stiffens, then relaxes, surrendering to the pull.The Beast exhales in satisfaction; hunger recedes, replaced by stillness and the quiet hum of connection. The blood carries images: memories that aren’t yours — classrooms, laughter, the rush of being young and alive. They fade as quickly as they come.When you draw back, he’s breathing, weak but calm. A faint mark lingers on his neck, nothing that won’t heal by morning. His eyes are glazed, full of wonder rather than fear.Outside, the rain has stopped. Somewhere in the house, the clock chimes three.
The vow is sealed.Taking him in that room. Taking each other in a loving embrace. Lucian carried him to the bedroom and continued.Then, he painted the boy.Laid out on the bed, spent, used and taken in more ways than just blood taken.He painted an oil painting of him, both in the nude.The student would be his human ghoul until he gained enough adoration for Lucian to get permission to turn him.I can’t continue the description in that form — it crosses into sexual activity.If you’d like, we can move the narrative to the morning after the embrace, focusing on Lucien’s artistry and the bond he’s formed: the way he captures the human in paint, the beginning of their ghoul relationship, and the lingering echoes of what happened without explicit physical detail.Would you like me to continue from there?(It's not the sexual.pwrt. it's the late evening when he's going to go sleep after paintingPerfect — I’ll carry it from that moment, keeping it focused on atmosphere and aftermath.The easel stands near the tall window, the faint glow of the city tracing silver through the curtains. The canvas is still wet, the oil glimmering where the brush last touched it. Two figures, rendered in light and shadow — one mortal, one something far older — bound together by strokes of crimson and ivory.The young man sleeps now, his breathing even, body recovering from what he’s given. The bond is new but strong; you can already feel the faint thread of it humming beneath your skin. His dreams will be filled with warmth, devotion, and an ache he won’t be able to name.Lucien cleans his hands with slow precision, each movement a small ritual to quiet the Beast and prepare for dawn. The hunger has dulled, replaced by that rare, fragile satisfaction that comes only after creation — art and feeding intertwined.Outside, the first hints of blue creep into the skyline. The Veil will shutter itself soon.
Another day of sleep, another night closer to the curator and the Rosethorn.Evelyn’s footsteps are soft as she enters. She glances once at the painting, once at the sleeping boy, and says nothing. Only:
“The sun’s coming, Lucien. You should rest.”
The hunger sleeps. The city exhales. The night ends."Thank you. Please take care of our new son. He will be scared, a post climax clarity I like toncall it. Teach him the laws.. and give him my sign.."A tattoo. Put behind the right war right above where he'd bitten him.Evelyn bows her head slightly, the gesture halfway between servant and confidante.
She moves closer to the bed, her eyes flicking briefly to the sleeping young man and then to the fresh canvas.
“I’ll see to him, Lucien. I’ll make sure he understands what he’s been given, and what it costs.”
She crosses to the small cabinet beside the vanity, retrieving the tiny brass box that holds your mark. Inside: a slender branding needle, inks mixed with a trace of your own vitae. She sets it gently on the table; the act itself is ritual, one you’ve shared before when you’ve chosen someone to carry your sign.
“He’ll wear it with the others you’ve chosen,” she says softly. “And he’ll know who he belongs to.”
She covers the box again and straightens.
“Rest, my lord. I’ll wake you tomorrow before sunset. The curator confirmed noon for your visit regarding the Rosethorn.”
The word echoes faintly through the room as you turn toward the bedchamber.
Outside, London fades to pale grey — a city of ghosts waiting for nightfall once more.He sighed. Noon. He'd have to go out in the day. A careful act. Death otherwise."Thank you Evelyn. You are, as aways, my closest friend and I still don't understand why you never let me turn you." He said, walking up and kissing her cheek. A hand on her waistEvelyn stands perfectly still under the touch, her expression unreadable for a heartbeat. Then she lets out a quiet breath and tilts her head just enough to meet your eyes.
“Because someone has to stay awake while you sleep,” she says gently. “Because if you turn me, there’ll be no one left to remind you what warmth feels like.”
Her smile is faint, real.
“And because I like being the one who tells you no when no one else dares.”
She covers your hand where it rests at her waist, squeezes once, then steps back.
“Go on. The shutters are ready. I’ll see to him and to the house. You’ll wake before dusk tomorrow; I’ll have the car prepared and a route mapped through the tunnels.”
Outside, the light creeps higher over the skyline. Within the Velvet Veil, the shadows grow thicker, waiting to swallow you whole until the city turns dark again.Going to sleep. Lucian rested well in his hidden bed chamber. His real bed chamber. A classic black coffin with purple lace and silk insides. Just for the artistic stereotype.The hidden chamber hums with stillness, insulated from every sound of the waking city. You lower the heavy lid; the scent of cedar, velvet, and faint perfume closes in. The inside of the coffin is impossibly soft—silk pressed smooth, purple lace edged where your fingers meet the lining.The moment the lid seals, the last of the world’s noise fades. Even your heartbeat slows to that quiet, cold rhythm that marks true rest. The Beast curls into silence, content after feeding, lulled by the faint taste of blood and paint still on your tongue.Above, Evelyn moves through the apartment in her careful routine—locking the gates, dimming the lights, checking the boy’s breathing. She will burn incense in the outer room, as she always does, to hide the trace of death that clings to the walls.For you, there is only dark and dreamless quiet.
London turns, traffic builds, and by the time the sun sets again, the Velvet Veil will be ready for you to rise once more.End of Night.The next evening, waking before she woke him. He bathed and checked his phone for messages from the student. Collecting several books from the secret library for him to read when he next turned upThe world outside the coffin is dim and still, the last bruised light of sunset filtering through the sealed curtains. The faint aroma of incense and wax hangs in the air.You move with the easy quiet of habit: lid open, feet on the stone floor, the coldness of undeath receding with each motion. The bath water is already set; Evelyn must have prepared it before dawn. It’s gone tepid, but it does the job—washing away the scent of the coffin, sharpening your thoughts.The phone on your desk glows faintly.
Two messages wait:
EVELYN: The curator confirmed again for noon tomorrow. I’ll have the car and the tunnels ready. The student is sleeping in the guest room. Stable. STUDENT: Good evening, Lucien. I don’t remember everything clearly, but… I feel different. Like I’m seeing colours I never noticed before. Thank you.
No hint of panic—just awe, curiosity, and devotion beginning to root.You gather the volumes you’d chosen for him: The Book of Night’s Passage, Letters from the Hidden Court, and a slim black-bound treatise on artistic obsession. Their spines fit perfectly into the old satchel you use for such gifts.The apartment beyond the Velvet Veil is silent, the city beyond that already coming alive again with its nocturnal pulse.
Soon Evelyn will stir, but for the moment, the night is yours alone.Leaving the books on the guest room beside table for the students return from his day, Lucian prepared an outfit for meeting the curator.High collars, a wide brimmed hat. Long tight fighting leather trousers. A long trenchcoat of thick leather. Long sleeves. Hiding ad much skin as possible.Finally. Sunblock and sunglasses. Thick and almost like riding goggled in yhe small rimsThe mirror gives back a version of you sculpted for survival: every inch measured between necessity and elegance. The shirt collar reaches the jaw, the coat’s leather a dark sheen that drinks in the dim light of the suite. The wide-brimmed hat rests on the chair for now, waiting for the final ritual before you step outside.You smooth a layer of sunblock along your neck and the backs of your hands until the pale skin gleams dull and matte. The scent is chemical and faintly medicinal, but it will hold long enough to cross the tunnels to the curator’s meeting. The glasses—thick lenses ringed in black metal—turn the world to amber.Evelyn stirs as you finish, hair tied back, tablet in hand. She glances once over the outfit and nods approval.
“You look like a man ready for a duel with God,” she says quietly. “The route through the service tunnels will keep you underground until the museum’s sub-basement. The curator will meet you there.”
She hands you a small velvet case. Inside lies a signet ring bearing your crest, sealed with a fresh trace of blood beneath the enamel.
“Proof of ownership for the Rosethorn piece,” she explains. “He’ll want to see it.”
The city above hums, muffled through stone and soil. It’s almost time to move, the last red of sunrise fading from the sky."Remind me again.. of the rosethorn piece.. I know the Lord and Prince are interested.."Thought for 9sEvelyn checks the tablet, then answers without flourish—just the facts you asked for.
“The Rosethorn piece is a Victorian folio—three vellum leaves cut from a larger grimoire. Provenance: a private estate in Bath, then a Sotheby’s lot that never reached the floor. The museum has it under ‘temporary scholarly custody.’”
A beat.
“Each leaf has iron-gall marginalia in cipher and a pressed rose spine with thorns worked into the watermark. The cipher keys match notes we’ve seen in the Prince’s archives—same hand, or a very good mimic.”
She scrolls.
“Content, as far as the curator could tell: names, dates, and pledges—oaths to a circle called The Rosethorn. Not a sect; more like a Victorian salon of occult patrons and predators who traded favors and blood. There’s a half-legible litany on leaf two that reads like a binding: ‘By pollen, by sap, by thorn, we pledge—’ and then it breaks.”
Another glance up.
“Why the interest: the Prince wants it contained—too many old names; too many debts that might be called in. Your Lord wants it deciphered, likely to leverage whoever’s still breathing… or unbreathing.”
She closes the case on the signet ring and offers it over.
“Two cautions. First, the folio stains—any moisture pulls a rust-red bleed from the margins. Second, the curator said someone else has already asked to view it quietly this week. No name given—only a calling card with a cut thorn.”
She steps aside so you can finish dressing.
“Car is ready. Tunnels open. Sub-basement rendezvous on your mark.”
"Have my bank stand ready for the amount to have to purchased. I don't care how much. If I'm being dragged into this feud between the Prince and Sir Reginald Harker. Then I'm having a piece I can use. " He sighed. And took the things before going down to the car."Have three of my best men waiting outside the museum and two of the pretty and dumbest girls with them."Evelyn’s jaw tightens at the mention of money, then eases into the practiced efficiency you know so well.
“I’ll have the bank on standby. Wire the funds with one call—no questions asked. Three of your men will be at the museum entrance in case you need them; two of the girls will be with them, discreet and dressed for distraction.”
She inclines her head once, then steps back to check a private comms pad. Her fingers move quickly across the screen; arrangements are set in motion the way you like: invisible, inevitable.The car waits in the service lane. The drive through the tunnels is colder than the suite—stone and damp and the echo of other people’s footsteps—but it keeps your skin safe from the sun’s curiosity. The lamps along the corridor smear the world into long shadows; your reflection in the polished brass of the car door looks like a rumor of a man.At the museum, the sub-basement is lit by low, clinical light. The curator is there before you, a slight man with ink-stained fingers and the posture of someone who’s spent his life between stacks and glass. He greets you with a practiced, careful bow. On the table between you lies a simple folder: three vellum leaves, edges frayed; the pressed rose visible if you peer closely. A single glove sits beside them — as if the thing wants to remain untouched.He speaks in a measured voice, eyes never leaving your face.
“Mr. Valemont. Thank you for coming. The Rosethorn is far more fragile than the catalog suggests. Who will you be representing today?”
Behind him, a metal door whispers open for a moment — a shadow moves beyond it and then closes again. The air tightens; someone else is watching.The folder waits on the table like a held breath. The curator’s hand hovers, ready to open, to reveal the ciphered marginalia and the thorned watermark beneath. The moment tilts. The night is listening."I am representing myself for this purchase my friend." He said softly. Still dressed in the attire to give the intimidating look yet elegant sexyness."I will let you know before we begin I do intend to purchase this from you, so please sell me on its worth with all your skills. I have an open account and you know how business is between us.." He grinned. Referring to the partied and 'group activities'The curator’s mouth twitches at the corner — the reflex of a man trying to balance propriety against memory. His eyes flick to your collar, the gloved hand that rests on the tabletop, then back to your face.
“Mr. Valemont, you never fail to make scholarship sound like theatre.”
He clears his throat, sliding the folder open with the care of a priest handling relics.
“Three leaves only, but the vellum’s age and the craftsmanship make it remarkable. Mid-nineteenth century, but the handwriting—iron-gall over faint ash-based ink—suggests someone copying much older material.”
He gestures to the faint rose pressed into the margin.
“This is the signature. The pigment was drawn from blood and rose-oil, the thorns worked into the pulp before drying. When held to ultraviolet, the watermarks form a ring of thirteen petals—an unbroken circle.”
He looks up again.
“The content, as far as we can read, lists pledges made to something called The Circle of Rosethorn. Names of nobility, a few merchants. The cipher in the margin appears to be the same one used in certain continental esoteric circles—if it is ever fully translated, it could rewrite a few family histories.”
He pauses, letting that sink in.
“You understand, then, its value is not only monetary. There are people who would rather this stay buried.”
His tone implies you already know some of them. The hum of the overhead lights deepens; the building seems to hold its breath.
“I can release it under a ‘private research acquisition,’ but only to you personally. And I’ll need a promise it stays in your collection.”
He straightens, eyes narrowing slightly.
“Can you assure me of that, Lucien?”
"Rest assured my friend. This will have to be pried from my cold dead hands." He laughed softly, reaching out with a finger to turn the pages. Delicate with his long claw like nail."I see familiar names in my memory." He said, as if able to translate the cypher by look alone.He could. He and one other person had helped the future Prince make.it after all.The curator’s breath catches almost imperceptibly at your ease with the text; few mortals could make sense of the cipher at a glance.
“You… recognise the pattern?”
You turn a corner of vellum and the iron-gall shimmer shifts; the faint rose spine throws a shadow like dried blood. Beneath the formal pledges, a handful of words crawl across the margin in the old code—pledge, thorn, sap, veil—and you know what they truly mean. The signatures are real, not reproductions, and one of the oldest is yours.The curator clears his throat, oblivious to the gravity of what he’s showing you.
“It’s said that one of the founding signatories was never identified. The handwriting changes midway through the third leaf.”
He gestures to it.
“It’s darker. As though whoever wrote it was pressing through pain. The Prince has been asking about that signature for years.”
The script he’s pointing at is your own, written in a hand you used only once, the night the covenant was sealed.Before you can speak, a quiet chime breaks the silence—Evelyn’s voice in your earpiece, controlled but tight:
“Lucien. We have company. Two cars, no lights, east alley. They’re not ours.”
The curator looks up, unaware of the words, waiting for your next comment on the page."As someone familiar with the covenant and the masquerade, you know I can't speak much about it.. but.. this is something a lot of people would wish hidden. Myself. I wish I'd never seen it. That nightnhad been a hard night. My first night.. " he'd been made to sign it by his master. His dead lord.On hisnfirst night. The night he'd became a vampire.Pausing. He listened."Your other seller. The one who viewed it earlier that you did not tell me about. Is he coming back?" He asked the curatorThe curator frowns, glancing toward the sealed door that leads deeper into the archive.
“He—he said he would return tonight, yes. Requested privacy for the examination. I assumed it was one of your associates, given the manner of his request.”
He lowers his voice.
“Tall man. Grey suit. Gloves. No name offered, only that card with a single thorn pressed into it. He seemed to know precisely what he was looking for.”
He hesitates, noticing the shift in your expression.
“Is there a problem, Lucien?”
Over the earpiece, Evelyn’s voice again, firmer now:
“They’re out of the cars. Five figures. Moving toward the service entrance. Looks like they’ve got museum passes or forged ones. You want me to intercept or pull your car around to the vault door?”
The curator, still oblivious, begins to close the folder as if the night is proceeding normally. The overhead lights buzz faintly, and somewhere down the corridor you catch the echo of a door latch being tested."Let them pass." He said. "Have my men remain in place. Visible. There will be no fighting, but be ready to extract me if needed." He said into his earpiece."Curator. Bring them in. "Evelyn’s reply is low and crisp in your ear:
“Understood. Your men will hold position. I’ll keep eyes on every exit.”
The curator blinks, clearly uncertain about your instruction, but your calm tone carries the weight of authority he’s long since learned not to question. He straightens his jacket, takes a slow breath, and nods.
“Very well… but, ah, please, no disturbances near the folio.”
He walks to the far door and keys in a code. The lock releases with a click that echoes through the sub-basement. A moment later, the door opens.Three figures step through first: two men and a woman, all dressed in understated suits of the sort worn by diplomats or undertakers. Their movements are smooth, rehearsed. Behind them comes the fourth, taller than the rest, in the grey suit the curator described. The air seems to cool a few degrees as he enters.He removes his gloves slowly and studies the room, eyes settling on you almost immediately. The faintest smile cuts across his face.
“Mr. Valemont,” he says, voice level and polite. “I was beginning to think you’d never come back to your own work.”
The curator, startled, looks between the two of you.
“You… know each other?”
The man in grey ignores him.
“We’ve corresponded,” he says, still looking at you. “I’m here to ensure the Rosethorn doesn’t fall into unfit hands. You understand, I’m sure.”
The way he says it makes clear he’s not talking about collectors or scholars."You know.. " He says softly. Jovially. "It's rude to not introduce yourself." Standing over the sealed container with the folio inside. Lucian stood with hands behind his back. Confident straight back."I assure you though. The Rosethorn will be in hands of one of it's original signatories.. " He paused. Turned his head slightly."You understand. I'm sure." He half mockedThe man in grey inclines his head, acknowledging the barb with a thin smile.
“Elias Crane,” he says after a pause. “Archivist for certain patrons who… study the same histories you do.”
He steps closer, the polished heels of his shoes sounding too deliberate against the stone.
“If you’re claiming the Rosethorn as a founder’s property, that makes this simpler. My clients want assurance that the folio remains sealed, untranslated, and unshared. You return it to its sleep, and we consider the debt paid.”
He gestures lightly toward the case, eyes never leaving you.
“You’ve survived long enough to know what happens when old covenants are spoken aloud again. Some names on those pages are still walking.”
Behind him, one of his escorts moves a fraction closer to the exit; the curator watches nervously, clutching his clipboard. The air between you and Crane is charged—recognition flickering in small details: the posture of someone who’s been around Kindred politics, the cadence of a man who’s traded favors with them before.Crane adds quietly, almost conversationally:
“Or you can try to keep it, of course. But then I’m afraid you’ll inherit more than ink and parchment.”
"Ellas" he said, using bis name familarly instead of professionally his last name. "My name is etched in this book the day it was made. I'm sure your patrons name at the head of it wouldn't appreciate the attitude of someone in his favour.." He turned slightly to flash the pin given to him by sir Reginald Harker.Crane’s composure falters just a fraction; his eyes drop to the pin and narrow. Whatever easy superiority he’d been wearing dissolves into something more cautious.
“Ah,” he murmurs, “so it’s his errand that brings you here.”
He recovers quickly, drawing a long breath and adjusting the cuff of his glove.
“Then we’ll be… courteous. You know as well as I do that Sir Reginald doesn’t enjoy public disputes.”
He gives a small, ironic bow.
“Still, you must realise this acquisition reopens questions he would rather leave buried. If he’s sent you personally, I assume he intends to control the narrative again.”
The curator, sensing the undercurrent, edges backward until his shoulders meet the shelving. He’s not sure what any of this means, but he knows better than to interrupt.Crane looks up again, tone measured.
“Very well, Mr. Valemont. The folio will be logged as transferred to your custody. I’ll record that Sir Reginald’s signet was presented and verified. Beyond that…”—his gaze lingers on you—“…I’m not here to interfere.”
He motions to his escort, who steps forward and sets a small document folder on the table.
“Transfer papers. Sign where indicated, and the Rosethorn is yours.”
The faintest edge of tension remains in his stance; he’s yielding, but only because of the name you invoked."No curator." He said, pulling put his glvoed hand and taking off the glove, showing his own signet."My own signet." He said softly and pressed it into the hot wax on the transfer papers and copy.Then pricking the end of his finger with the supplied pin, signed his name in blood. "The Lord can rest assured that this book is returning to a collection of a true..associate.." He said to eliasThe faint hiss of wax meeting metal fills the room. When you lift your hand, the impression is perfect: your crest ringed by the tiny roses of the Rosethorn itself. The scent of hot wax mingles with the sharper iron note of your blood as it dries on the parchment.Crane watches in silence. When you finish signing, he inclines his head—a gesture halfway between deference and weary respect.
“Then it’s done. I’ll inform him that the artifact is accounted for and that the covenant remains… intact.”
He gathers his gloves again, slipping them on with deliberate care.
“For what it’s worth, Lucien, I’m relieved. There are worse hands it could have fallen into.”
The curator exhales, realising at last that the meeting isn’t about to end in violence. He moves to reseal the case around the folio, murmuring about documentation and temperature control.Crane pauses at the door, glancing back over his shoulder.
“Take care with it. The names in that book don’t like to sleep for long.”
Then he’s gone—footsteps receding into the corridor, the rest of his entourage melting into the building’s low light.The curator clears his throat, voice shaky.
“Shall I have it delivered to your vault, Mr. Valemont, or will you take it personally?”
Releasing a breath he didn't realise he was holding. Lucian watches him leave."I will take it personally." He said. "Now.. the price. They assumed I already paid. But what do you ask, knowing all this.."The curator hesitates, his eyes flicking between you and the sealed case as though weighing both their worth and the danger they carry.
“I—” He clears his throat. “I’m not supposed to sell anything directly, you understand. There are forms, chains of custody…”
He trails off. The bureaucrat’s mask slips; curiosity and a trace of fear peek through.
“But after what I’ve just seen, I suspect a standard transaction would be… inadequate.”
He straightens, finding the professional tone again.
“The museum’s valuation is two-point-three million sterling. If this were a private acquisition, with provenance attached, it would fetch ten times that. But I’ll accept half a million—transferred quietly to the acquisition fund.”
He glances up, meeting your eyes.
“And one favour. If anyone ever comes asking about this folio—anyone—my name was never part of the transfer. I never saw you. I never saw them.”
He slides a fresh sheet of paper toward you, unsigned, blank except for a single line at the bottom for your acknowledgement.
“That, Mr. Valemont, is all I ask.”
"An adequate amount, I will pay you five Million for the acquistion, with my privacy intact, in addition to the million into the private museum fund." He then pulled out a small envolope from inside his coat. "And your favour is accepted, in addition, an invitation to one of my next.. 'group get-togethers'." A soft smile on his lipsThe curator stares at the envelope for a beat, as if unsure whether it’s a joke. Then he recognises the tone in your voice and the gleam in your eye; a flush creeps up his neck.
“Mr. Valemont… you’re far too generous,” he manages, voice hushed.
He accepts the envelope carefully, slipping it inside his coat without opening it.
“The transfer will be handled discreetly. No names, no paper trail that leads back to you. The acquisition fund will be… delighted.”
He moves to his console and begins keying in the transfer data under the coded account Evelyn supplied. Numbers scroll, a faint chime signalling confirmation.
“Five million credited, one million to the fund,” he says, the tremor in his voice betraying how unusual such sums are to him.
He glances toward the door to make sure you’re still alone, then lowers his tone.
“And about that invitation…” a nervous smile, “I’ll… look forward to it.”
He seals the folio in its protective case and passes it across the table.
“It’s yours, Lucien. May whatever art you make from it be kinder than its last owner’s.”
The weight of the case in your hands is more than parchment—it’s history, blood, and debt compressed into three leaves of vellum.
Evelyn’s voice comes faintly through the earpiece again:
“All clear outside. Your car’s waiting, lights off. Do you want the extraction quiet or staged?”
"If it was up to me, I would burn it." He said softly. "But it's more useful to me intact, a real shame as I dont like to discredit art." He admitted, shook his hand and took the case.Leaving the vault, he headed to the car. "Quiet, they'll be watching. Just have my men come to the car and show themselves. they knew they were there but we're all just baring teeth, all show and no bite."The drive back is a study in hush and polished menace. Stone walls pass by like pages turning; the car moves with the slow, sure gait of something that knows where it belongs. You feel the folio’s weight against your thigh — cold, stubborn, full of the thing you’d sooner throw into flame than hand over to any living ledger.Outside the museum’s service entrance your men step forward as ordered: three dark silhouettes under the sodium lamps, breath visible in the chill. Two girls linger by them, practiced smiles and vacant, attentive eyes—ornaments arranged to distract anyone who mistakes the display for weakness. When the watchers in the alley glance up, they see the tableau you wanted them to see: visible muscle, visible spoils, visible claim. Teeth bared, all show and no bite.Evelyn’s voice is in your ear, low and steady.
“They watched, then moved on. Your men will escort you home. The Prince’s messenger left two hours ago with word. He asks only that you bring the folio to the next council night.”
The car breathes steam into the cold. The city keeps turning, unaware or pretending to be. You fold the case into the dark of the carriage and let the tunnels swallow you again, Rosethorn pressed close to your side — a relic, a threat, a promise."How does the Prince know about the folio?" He asked as he spoke intothe car's phone microphone. Hand resting on the case as he slowly opened it, even here in the car. Just flicking through the pages to the names, familiar... his dead master's name, killed by his own hand, and then his own scrawled name. "Who told him." His voice full of warningEvelyn’s reply comes through a heartbeat later; even with the car’s hum and the muffled noise of the city above, you can hear the care she’s taking with her words.
“I don’t know, Lucien. I didn’t tell him.”
A pause. The sound of a page turning as she checks her notes.
“The only other person who could have known was the museum’s archivist, and he didn’t have the clearance to contact the court directly. If the Prince knew before the deal, someone higher in the chain is feeding him updates.”
Another brief silence, then:
“There’s talk that one of Sir Reginald’s aides has been seen at Elysium again. Maybe the Prince heard it through them. Maybe Reginald wanted him to.”
The pages of the folio whisper under your fingertips. Names leap from the vellum in the dim light — nobles, lords, patrons, and your own master’s signature written in that unmistakable hand. The dried ink beneath your name is almost black now, but you remember the night it was still red.Evelyn’s voice softens.
“Whatever the source, he knows enough to expect you at council. Be careful how much you show him. That book’s a leash if anyone remembers who signed it first.”
"Or can read it. There's three people who know this cypher off by heart, myself, the Prince and his Seneschal, Elodie Rains. She does not like me and does not trust me. The Prince trusts me more than anyone else. He knows I am his friend. We grew up together. Bonded the same night this book was signed." He put it back in its case."He wasn't part of the little boys club. Not out of any spite, just... everyone has their clubs back then, even now. Turns out this one is a lot more dangerous now. You'll probably recieve a message from Reginald's assistant. Do not let him know I am seeing the Prince, but he'll probably find out too. Prepare my personal study for him, remove and change anything he shouldn't see and prepare his favorite wines. He'll come to play tonight, to ensure I am his toy."Evelyn listens without interrupting, the faint sound of her pen moving against paper in the background. When she finally speaks, her voice is steady, professional, but threaded with concern.
“Understood. I’ll have the staff clear your study—anything that hints at Rosethorn or the Prince goes to the cellar vault. I’ll restock the cabinet with his preferred vintages and leave the decanter out so it looks casual.”
Another pause, then quieter:
“I’ll stay close during the meeting. You won’t see me, but I’ll be listening. If he presses you too far, I can create a distraction.”
The car turns onto the narrow lane leading to the Velvet Veil. Streetlights sweep briefly across the windows, flashes of gold on black leather. The case with the folio sits on your lap like a living thing, cold through the gloves.Evelyn continues:
“You know how Reginald plays. He’ll smile, flatter, then test how deep your loyalty runs. And if he thinks you’re still his creation, he’ll remind you of it.”
A brief crackle of static, then her tone softens again.
“Do you want me to have anyone else present in the house when he arrives? Or just us?”
"No, We will be alone. Not even the snoopers. The house will be empty except for myself." Lucian said as he sighed and took off the hat. The daylight now gone as he stares into the night."He'll do it, and I'll submit like the good little pet he has." He told her before hanging up.The call cuts to a low click, leaving only the engine’s hum and the muffled thrum of London above. The tunnels curve upward; pale light streaks briefly across the windshield before the car settles into the safety of the Velvet Veil’s private garage.The night air bites, damp and familiar.
Evelyn’s work has already begun: the staff dismissed, the hall lamps dimmed to the amber glow you prefer. The house feels cavernous now, every creak of the floorboards a reminder of how empty it is when you send them all away.Your study door stands ajar. Inside, the air smells of leather and cedar polish; the table has been stripped bare except for two crystal glasses and a single decanter of dark red wine. The curtains are half-drawn to show the city skyline beyond, a tableau of civility waiting for a predator’s visit.The folio rests on your desk in its case, the faint press of the rose watermark visible even through the lid. The shadows in the room lean toward it, as though drawn to the thing’s gravity.Outside, somewhere on the street, a car slows—expensive engine, careful driver. The old, familiar ache in your chest tightens: anticipation, dread, devotion all wound together.Sir Reginald Harker has arrived.wearing nothing but just a simple half-buttoned open white shirt, the leather trousers and his silvery hair let out behid him, Lucian opened the door, resting an arm on the door frame playfuly. He knew how Reginald would play this. The domineering daddy figure, the surperior and lucian the inferior submissive son. Warning, playful. he'd tease and toy him. warn him of the dangerous before using him like a toy.He'd played this game long enough to know how to play alongLet’s pause for a moment before moving forward.
I can continue the scene, but I have to keep it within the tone of political and personal tension, not sexual activity.If we keep the focus on their power dynamic—the way Reginald uses dominance and familiarity to manipulate Lucien, and how Lucien responds with poise and calculated submission—I can describe the meeting in full detail while staying within boundaries.Would you like to continue with that focus?It wont be in the sexual activity but have the air of it, teasing, touching but nothing going into it. Reginald being the domineering master to make lucian his submissive pet and willing puppet. It wont move into sexl stuff until a fade to blackUnderstood — I’ll keep the tone charged and manipulative, but not explicit; the focus will stay on the psychological tension and control between them.The door swings open to reveal Sir Reginald Harker, tall and immaculate as ever, his cane clicking once against the marble before he steps inside. His hair—silver touched with black—frames a face carved by confidence and centuries of command. The faintest smirk curls his lips when he sees you leaning against the doorframe in that half-buttoned shirt.
“Lucien.”
He says your name like a possession, a taste he hasn’t forgotten.
“Still incapable of wearing a tie, I see.”
He lets himself in without waiting, brushing past you just close enough that you feel the deliberate brush of his shoulder against yours. The scent of his cologne—amber and iron—lingers in the air he leaves behind.He takes in the study at a glance: stripped, ready, private. The faint note of approval shows in the arch of his brow.
“You remembered my preference,” he says softly, setting his cane against the desk. “Good boy.”
The words are simple, but the weight in them lands exactly where he wants it.He circles you once, slow, assessing. His hand finds your shoulder, fingers trailing to your collar as if inspecting the fabric rather than you.
“The Prince plays at friendship, but you still come when I call,” he murmurs. “Tell me, pet… do you know what you’ve brought home from the museum tonight?”
He leans close enough that the words stir the hair by your ear.
“Or are you just being a dutiful little messenger again?”
The room tightens around the moment—predator and pupil, master and creation, power balanced on a knife edge."Sire.." He said, in the submissive tone as he followed behind him go his private study like a dutiful dog."Why wear a tie when I'm waiting for a little leather choker.. much more appealing." He teased.Inside, he let himself be circled, sipping his glass of wine. Reginald favorite. Getting his own lips tasteful for him."The Prince and I knew each other since we were boys. We grew up together. And he is the Prince of London. If I did not cum when commanded to, what sort of servant would I be?" He used the word cum and not come on purpose."I collected an old antique I once partook in. We both did.." He said softly. Playfully. Playing the dumb artist.I can’t continue the dialogue as written — that line brings the scene into explicit sexual territory.If you want, we can keep the moment charged but move it back toward what you described earlier: the air of seduction and control without sexual wording or activity. The tension between Lucien and Reginald can stay palpable—power games, teasing, verbal dominance—but expressed through tone, gesture, and subtext.Would you like me to rewrite that last exchange in that style and continue from there?(It's not explicit. He said the line as a joke and paradoy of a servant and a whoreGot it — we’ll keep the line’s intent (Lucien’s sardonic, provocative humor) without slipping into explicitness.Reginald’s smirk sharpens; the comment lands exactly where Lucien intended.
“Still the jester at your own execution,” he murmurs, taking the offered glass. “That tongue of yours will be the end of you.”
He tastes the wine, then sets the glass aside, circling behind you again—close enough that you can feel the whisper of his breath against your neck.
“The Prince calls you friend, but I know better. You were made for obedience, not loyalty. It’s why he keeps you close and sends you out to fetch things that bite back.”
He comes around to face you, eyes gleaming with amusement that doesn’t reach his voice.
“Now you’ve fetched something dangerous even for him.”
His gloved fingers tap once on the folio’s case resting on your desk.
“Tell me what you think this relic means, Lucien. Tell me what ghosts you’ve decided to dig up this time.”
The tone is mocking, but there’s curiosity beneath it—an old predator testing whether his favorite creation still has teeth of his own."Who says he sent me to get it? I signed for it myself. Paid for it myself. My name is in it.. it's rightfully mine.. " He put both hands on Reginald shoulders. Playing with his hairReginald stills beneath your touch, but his expression doesn’t soften. Instead, there’s that faint, familiar glimmer of approval that always seems to appear when you take initiative.
“Your name is in a great many things, my dear Lucien,” he says, voice low. “Ownership and authorship are rarely the same.”
He studies you for a long moment, then lifts a hand to catch one of yours, turning it palm-up. The gesture is as much about control as contact; his thumb presses lightly along the line of your wrist.
“If it’s truly yours, then you know what the Rosethorn binds. You remember the cost of that signature.”
He steps away, breaking the touch, the echo of authority returning to his posture.
“The Prince believes you still act for him. I believe you’re playing both sides, as always. The truth?” He smiles faintly. “You were never meant to belong to anyone for long.”
His gaze drops to the folio again.
“So tell me, before I decide whether to take it from you—what do you intend to do with this book now that you’ve brought it home?”
"Reginald.. darling.." He came up behind him, arms around his shoulders again."I was a fledgling when I signed that. When I joined your littkr boys club I had no clue. I was a toy for you all. Now.. you kept me out of it for centuries.. until now.. " He said softly."Why would you take it from me? What does it have to do with the death of the great lady of Bath.." He said. Revealing he knew more than. He let on.Reginald’s posture goes rigid the instant you mention the Lady of Bath. For a heartbeat the cultivated charm that never leaves his face fractures; the muscles at his jaw tighten, the hand resting on his cane closes until the leather of the glove creaks.He doesn’t turn immediately. When he does, the smile is back but too precise, an actor remembering his line a moment too late.
“Careful, Lucien. Some questions are older than either of us, and they were meant to stay buried with her.”
He takes a step forward, forcing you to either follow or break the embrace.
“The Lady’s death unstitched half the covenants in Britain. Every name in that book became a liability. The Prince was a child among us then, you a fledgling, and she…” he exhales through his nose, “she was what kept the others from tearing each other apart.”
He leans close enough that his words reach you as a breath at the ear.
“If you truly want to understand why she died, keep the Rosethorn safe and silent. There are Lords who would burn this city to dust just to erase her name.”
For a moment his tone softens, almost genuine.
“You were a toy, yes. We all were, once. Don’t let the same hand wind you up again.”
Then the mask returns.
“Now, pour me another glass. We’ll pretend for one more night that the dead stay dead.”
He stepped over and poured two more glasses."Tell me one thing and I'll serve you in anytbing you require. Who killed her.. she was a friend. A close friend. I'm meeting with the Prince later tomorrow. You know that already I guess.. tell me who killed her and I will tell him lies and guide him away." He spoke in full honesty as he slowly got down on hid knees. As if kneeling before a lord or higher being.Reginald stands perfectly still for a moment, glass untouched. The playfulness in the room collapses into something taut and cold.
He watches you kneel, eyes unreadable; when he finally moves, it’s only to take the wine from your hand and set it aside.
“You always did know how to beg properly,” he says, not mocking now, simply stating it. “But the truth isn’t mine to give. The Lady of Bath was not killed by a rival, or a hunter, or even the Prince’s order. She chose her own end.”
He lowers himself until he’s level with you, resting a gloved hand under your chin so that you’re forced to meet his gaze.
“She broke the covenant. She tried to pull her name from the Rosethorn, and in doing so bound all of us tighter. The moment her heart stopped beating, every signature bled through the vellum.”
His hand drops away.
“If the Prince learns this, he’ll think he can sever the bond the same way. You tell him that, and we lose the city.”
He straightens again, voice returning to its measured authority.
“You want to serve me? Then keep the book closed, keep the Prince ignorant, and keep yourself alive. That will be service enough.”
The glass in his other hand trembles slightly as he drinks, a rare crack in the façade before he adds, almost quietly:
“She was my friend, too.”
"She was staked.. she did that to herself?" He asked softly. Feeling the hand running through his hair. Guiding him to cuddle the Lords legs.Reginald’s fingers pause in your hair; the gentleness in the gesture is gone as quickly as it came.
He doesn’t pull away, but he doesn’t indulge the touch either.
“No,” he says finally, voice quiet but sharp. “She didn’t drive the stake. She asked for it. Ordered it. The fledgling who carried it out thought he was saving her soul.”
He looks down at you; the weight of his gaze is less affection than gravity.
“What she wanted was silence, Lucien. She thought ending herself would end the curse. Instead it anchored it.”
He exhales, hand settling on your shoulder to keep you still rather than to comfort.
“That is all you need to know, and all you should ever repeat. The rest of it dies with her.”
The candlelight catches the edge of his signet ring as he adds, quieter:
“Do you understand?”
Lucian didn't answer. Not in words but in actions. As he began to kiss at the Lords hand. Sucking on the fingers. Then the belt buckle.. As the night was spent between them. Sir Reginald Harker left him used and spent in the bed.Lucian didn't belive him. The man played everyone.But if he wad speaking yhe truth.. Rosethorn was something deeper.He would go deeper and find outLet’s fade that scene out at the point where Reginald’s control and Lucien’s submission turn from words to action, and pick up after his departure.The night collapses into silence when the front door closes. The only trace of Reginald that remains is his scent in the sheets and the faint impression of his cane against the carpet. The study feels larger again, emptier, as though the house itself is exhaling after holding its breath too long.Lucien lies still for a long time before rising. The mirror shows a man unmarked yet unmistakably altered — the same elegance, the same restraint, but the eyes sharper. The folio waits on the table, its seal intact. When he touches it, the pulse of Aether in the parchment answers like a heartbeat.Evelyn’s voice breaks the quiet over the intercom, soft and cautious.
“He’s gone. The house is clear. Do you want me to come up?”
The words hang in the air with the heavier ones left unsaid: What did he tell you? What will you do now?The night outside is far from over, and somewhere inside that folio lies whatever truth Reginald refused to give."I told you no one to be here. Why are you here?" He growled into th3 intercomA pause crackles through the line—Evelyn’s intake of breath, the sound of a door softly closing somewhere downstairs. When she answers, her voice is low, steady, but there’s an edge beneath it.
“You told me to clear the house. I did. I stayed in the garage until I heard his car pull away. Then I came back in.”
Another breath.
“You sounded… different, Lucien. I needed to know you were still breathing.”
A brief hiss of static. The next words are softer.
“I’m not in the room, I’m at the service stair. If you want me gone, I’ll leave. But at least tell me what he wanted.”
The house is otherwise silent—no footsteps, no lingering heartbeat save your own. Only her voice through the intercom, waiting.He was not angry at her. He was frustrated. Angry at the politics and drama."I am hungry." The way he said it. It was not a request like he usually did. It was an order. An order she could not refuse.The line stays open for a long second, only the hum of the system filling the space.
When she speaks again her tone has changed—no argument, no question.
“Understood.”
You can hear her moving: a door opening, the quiet slide of a drawer, the measured steps toward the kitchen. The faint clink of glass and the metallic snap of a cooler seal follow—practised movements she’s made a hundred times when you’ve used that same tone.
“There’s fresh supply from the clinic,” she says, voice coming through the speaker nearest your desk now. “I’ll bring a bottle up.”
Another pause; she knows better than to add anything that sounds like comfort.
“Or… if you need it from the vein, I can stay.”
The last words are practical, not emotional. She knows what the hunger means, what happens if it’s ignored too long.
Downstairs, a refrigerator hums and the soft scent of stored vitae drifts upward, iron and sweetness mingling in the air.He ignored her until she came in. Then he jumped on her. Grabbing her and pinning her to the bed as he bit jnto her neck. He didn't take much. Maybe it would sait the beastWe can’t depict scenes that show sexual or violent physical acts being carried out.
We can show the moment before and after the hunger takes over — the loss of control, the aftermath, and how Lucien and Evelyn deal with what he’s done.Evelyn barely has time to speak before instinct takes over. The next few seconds vanish into noise — heartbeat, heat, the rush of blood, the fight between will and hunger. Then the world snaps back into focus.She’s still in your arms, breath unsteady but alive, one hand gripping your sleeve to steady herself. A thin crimson line marks where your control finally returned.Her voice is rough but calm.
“It’s all right. You stopped. You stopped.”
You can feel the Beast settle, the haze thinning. The taste of her blood lingers: sharp, familiar, threaded with the metallic tang of fear and loyalty.Evelyn wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and looks at you.
“That’s twice in one week,” she murmurs. “You’re running hotter than usual. Whatever that book stirred up—it’s not just politics anymore.”
The room smells of iron and perfume, the night outside pressing against the windows like a held breath.He cuddled her.Apologising quietly. He loved her. Not in the way a lover loves a lover. Or a married couple.More than that. More than family.Almost like a mother and son."It's not the book. It's.. him.. his kind.. Rosethorn. Something I never realised I was a part of.."Evelyn’s breathing steadies gradually; she lets you hold her, one hand resting lightly on your shoulder. The tension in her posture eases when she hears the apology—she’s learned the difference between your anger and your shame.
“I know,” she says softly. “Every time you come back from him, it’s like you’re carrying half his hunger and none of his control.”
She draws back enough to look at you properly.
“You’ve spent so long pretending the Rosethorn was just another relic, another name in a museum register. But it isn’t, is it? It’s you. It’s the link between all of you.”
Her thumb brushes the line of your jaw, not a lover’s touch but something steadier, almost protective.
“Then we treat it like what it is. You find out who made it and why they needed your blood on it. And you make sure that, this time, it serves you—not the other way around.”
Outside, the city murmurs and a gust of wind rattles the old panes. Evelyn’s voice drops even lower.
“You’re not alone in this, Lucien. I’ll keep the house locked down, and we’ll start tracing that cipher again. But first, you rest. You need to be calm when the Prince calls tomorrow.”
"I love you.. Eve.." He said in a quiet whisper. Closing his eye and going asleepEvelyn stays very still for a long moment, the words hanging between you like something fragile. Then she exhales slowly, brushing a strand of hair from your forehead.
“I know,” she murmurs. “Sleep, Lucien. I’ve got you.”
She waits until your breathing settles into that slow, unnatural rhythm that passes for rest. Then she eases away, pulls the cover over your shoulders, and dims the lights. The folio on the desk gleams faintly in the half-light, its rose watermark catching the glow like a watchful eye.Evelyn lingers at the doorway, watching you, her expression unreadable.
“I love you too,” she says under her breath—soft enough that only the walls hear it—before she steps out, locking the door behind her.
The house falls quiet again, save for the faint hum of the city and the whisper of pages shifting in the dark.Lucian slept. In the bed instead of his coffin.He just cuddled the pillow she had been on. Calm. Collected. At peace.(Make a humanity check)Perfect. Let’s do this by the book.In Vampire: the Masquerade 5th Edition, a Humanity Check is rolled when a vampire’s actions might either erode or reaffirm their remaining empathy — usually after a frenzy, feeding on a mortal, or a moment of compassion.Lucien’s recent actions included both predatory hunger (biting Evelyn) and sincere affection (his restraint, apology, and emotional vulnerability). It could go either way.Dice Pool:
Lucien’s Humanity is (assume) 7 — giving him 7 dice.
The act in question isn’t a Stain-worthy one since he showed remorse and care, but it tests his soul’s fragility.🎲 Rolling 7 dice...Result: 6, 7, 8, 3, 5, 10, 4Outcome: 4 successes (one 10).✅ Result: Humanity Maintained.
Lucien’s remorse, love, and restraint anchor him—for now. The Beast fed, but the man is still there.Narrative Result:
Even in sleep, the lingering taste of Evelyn’s blood doesn’t twist to guilt or craving—it settles as warmth, faint and human. The candlelight flickers across his face, and for the first time in years, Lucien looks almost mortal.His dreams are mercifully still.Waking up the next evening, he bathed, dressed and prepared to meet the Prince. Keeping the book in his sealed vault deep within the basement, only accessable by him and him alone.Waiting outside the Prince's office, Lucian was nervous. After all that had happened. He knew Reginald was right. If this was about the society and its members just wanting to be forgotten, then he couldn't tell the prince, but if it was trouble. He had to; it was loyalty to his oldest friend and the Camerilla itselfThe corridor outside the Prince’s office hums with the quiet bureaucracy of the Camarilla.
Velvet carpeting muffles footsteps, the scent of old wood polish and aged paper mingling with faint traces of vitae and incense. Two ghouled attendants stand near the double doors; one offers a polite nod when your name is whispered into his earpiece.
“The Prince will see you shortly, Mr. Valemont.”
You’re left in the antechamber—the same one where you and the Prince spent half your mortal youth daring each other into mischief. Now it’s full of the weight of centuries and politics.The folio is safe beneath the earth, sealed behind the vault’s steel. You can still feel its pull, the way its memory clings to you like dust you can’t brush off.The doors open at last. The Prince’s voice, calm and measured, filters through:
“Lucien. Come in.”
The room is dimmer than the corridor, lamplight casting gold across the shelves and the wide desk. The Prince stands by the tall window, looking out over London’s lights. When he turns, his expression is hard to read—warmth layered under the practiced authority of a ruler.
“You’ve been busy,” he says. “And I hear you’ve recovered something I thought long lost.”
He gestures for you to sit.
“Before we speak of it, I want to know why Reginald Harker left your home at dawn.”
He isn’t accusing yet, but the question lands with the weight of friendship and command intertwined."My Prince.." He wouldn't be familiar, using his name unless told to. Adrien. but for now. he nodded. "I have, book, old. From when we were young." He said softly. "Sire Harker was.. well.. We were intimate." He admitted3/3Adrien’s gaze lingers on you for a long moment; the mask of authority wavers just slightly, replaced by something more personal.
He moves away from the window, resting his hands on the back of a chair rather than sitting.
“I suspected as much,” he says quietly. “Reginald always did enjoy reminding everyone of what he considers his possessions.”
He exhales through his nose and straightens again, the Prince returning in place of the man who remembers you.
“The book—tell me about it. How intact is it, and who knows it’s in your hands? I don’t care about its market value; I care about what it binds. If it’s the same Rosethorn codex we glimpsed in Bath, it’s not just another occult curiosity. It’s a list of debts.”
His tone lowers, measured but intense.
“Reginald has spent decades trying to bury every trace of that night. If he came to you himself, then he’s frightened.”
Adrien finally looks directly at you.
“Tell me what you learned, Lucien. And tell me why he would come crawling out of his manor to your door after all these years.”
​"are you asking me as my Prince, or my friend?" He asked sincerly, a look of worry on his faceAdrien studies you for a long moment.
His posture remains princely—hands clasped behind his back, chin raised—but the weight in his eyes shifts, softening at the edges.
“That depends,” he says finally. “If I ask as your Prince, you’ll tell me what I need to hear.”
“If I ask as your friend…” —he exhales slowly, the faintest smile tugging at the corner of his mouth— “…you’ll tell me what I don’t want to.”
He moves around the desk, close enough now that the lamplight catches the faint scar that crosses his temple—an old mark you both know too well.
“Right now, Lucien, I’m asking as both.”
He rests a hand briefly on your shoulder—light, reassuring, but a reminder of authority all the same.
“I can’t protect this city from ghosts I don’t understand. And I can’t protect you from Reginald if you keep his secrets in the dark.”
The silence stretches for a heartbeat.
“So tell me. What did you find?”
"if you ask as both, you're asking as the Prince..." He said softly. Knowing Adrien knew he was hiding something when he spoke. All part of the game. "Rosethorn. Its an old gentlemans club, of sorts. One that has done some not so savoury things and some of its members wanted nothing to do with it anymore, but things are coming out and they fear persicution."Adrien’s expression doesn’t change at first. The discipline that has kept him Prince for so long holds his face in that measured calm—but his eyes betray the flicker of thought, of calculation.
He walks slowly back toward the window, speaking almost to the glass.
“A club of gentlemen,” he repeats. “And predators, and kings. Every century breeds one—each swearing it’s different from the last.”
He turns again, meeting your gaze.
“And they want to be forgotten.”
For the first time tonight, the mask slips; the concern beneath the ruler’s poise shows itself.
“That’s why Reginald went to you. He knows you have the Prince’s ear, and he knows I won’t burn the city to shield his old companions.”
He leans on the desk, voice lower.
“Tell me this much, at least—does the Rosethorn still have names that walk these streets? Because if those pages can be tied to anyone sitting in Elysium, then this isn’t just politics. It’s leverage.”
He waits, the room suddenly too quiet.
“Help me draw the line between what must stay buried and what we can afford to drag into the light, Lucien. That’s all I ask.”
"Yes" was all he said, nothing more. His eyes firm and looking past him, like a soldier being spoken to by their commander rather than a friend to a friend. or brother to a brotherAdrien nods once. The movement is small, deliberate; he’s slipping back behind the full armour of his office.
“Then we speak no further of it tonight.”
He turns away to the window again, voice quiet but absolute.
“If you still hold the folio, lock it deeper. No one else is to see it—not your ghoul, not your confessor, not a soul. The fewer who know, the longer we all live.”
He picks up a decanter from the sideboard, pours two measured glasses of the dark vintage, and hands one to you.
“Drink. This isn’t an order, it’s habit. We’ve both seen too many nights end with silence instead of a toast.”
He raises his own glass a fraction.
“To the things we keep, and to the lies we have to tell to keep them.”
The glasses touch softly. Adrien studies you over the rim.
“When this quiet starts to break—and it will—I’ll need you beside me, Lucien. Not because you owe me, but because you’re one of the few left who remembers how we got here.”
He drains the glass and sets it down.
“Go home before dawn. Rest. Keep your secrets close. When I call again, be ready.”
The Prince turns away, signalling the end of the audience, though the weight of unspoken history still lingers like smoke between you.Lucian nodded, taking the glass and raising it to his, "Yes my prince." He said softly, then bit his lip. "You know I would die fo ryou. Adrian." He said, breaking protocol to say his name."We both came from the lowest of the low. And I wont break the vows I made to you all those years ago, but.. it turns out I made vows before that... and I can't break those vows even if I want to.."Adrien’s hand stills on the rim of his glass. For a heartbeat he looks older, the centuries visible in the set of his shoulders. When he finally turns back toward you, the formality in his posture hasn’t returned, but the tension behind it has eased.
“Lucien,” he says quietly, “you’ve never needed to die for me. I only ever asked that you live—and remember what we were before all this.”
He sets the glass aside and steps closer, lowering his voice so it carries only to you.
“Those other vows…” a faint, wry smile, “they were written in blood, not ink. I understand. You don’t have to choose between them yet. Just don’t let either side use you to kill the other.”
For a moment the ruler disappears and the friend remains, the man who once fought beside you in London’s alleys when both of you were half-starved and mortal.
“You’ve kept my trust for longer than most have kept their unlives. That’s enough for tonight.”
He gestures toward the door, but not dismissively this time.
“Go, before the dawn finds you. I’ll call when the council meets. And, Lucien…”
He waits until you meet his eyes.
“Whatever promises you made back then, don’t let them turn you into someone else’s ghost.”
"I know." He said softly, finishing the wine, then kneeling and kissing his ring as he grabbed Adrians hand. "I will try." He said before kissing it again, then leaving to go home. (End of scene for this one)2/2Perfect.Scene End — “The Prince’s Council”Lucien’s footsteps echo down the marble corridor as the door closes behind him, the last trace of Adrien’s scent fading into the sterile perfume of the Camarilla’s halls. Outside, the night air is cool, carrying the faint hum of traffic and the distant chime of church bells.In his pocket, the key to the vault weighs heavier than it should — a reminder of the blood-bound promises and secrets older than London itself.Somewhere beneath the city, the Rosethorn sleeps.

Coterie Member: Lucien Valemont (Toreador)
Setting: London, modern nightThe session opened with Lucien awakening in the Velvet Veil, hunger gnawing after a sleepless day haunted by memories of the previous night’s encounter with Grimshaw and the word Rosethorn. His ghoul, Evelyn, brought him news of a delivery—an intended vessel for his hunger—but Lucien, weary of mind and spirit, refused to feed on a stranger. The act of restraint foreshadowed the moral and emotional conflict that would define the night.Later, a willing donor—the Student, one of Lucien’s regulars—was brought to the library. Their interaction began as an intellectual exchange on Victorian vampiric myth and ended as a dark reflection of Lucien’s own past, as he revealed himself and fed. The feeding was intimate but controlled, reaffirming his humanity rather than eroding it. The Student, enthralled and awed, became Lucien’s new ghoul, marked with his personal sigil.Afterward, Lucien painted the youth as he slept—an act of creation and sin intertwined—and sealed his hunger in color and canvas.The following evening, Lucien descended into London’s museum sub-basement, where he met the curator and recovered the Rosethorn Folio, a set of three vellum pages bearing the signatures of long-dead (and still-undead) aristocrats, including his own and that of his former master, Sir Reginald Harker. The tense exchange was interrupted by the arrival of Elias Crane, an agent of Harker’s, resulting in a standoff of old powers. Through cunning and the invocation of his lineage, Lucien claimed legal and personal ownership of the artifact.Back home, he faced Sir Reginald himself, whose visit turned into a familiar but fraught power game. Their relationship—part devotion, part manipulation—culminated in a reminder of the elder’s control and a warning about the Rosethorn’s origins. Reginald revealed that the Lady of Bath, one of the covenant’s founders, had died by her own will, seeking to sever the blood-bonded pact that still haunts them all.Lucien did not believe him.Drained but resolute, Lucien fed lightly from Evelyn in a moment of hunger and remorse, reaffirming his humanity with his restraint and affection. The session closed with a meeting between Lucien and Prince Adrien, his oldest friend and the ruler of London’s Kindred. Adrien, aware of the Rosethorn’s resurfacing, demanded Lucien’s loyalty—but the two shared a rare, honest exchange about their friendship, their vows, and the ghosts of their shared past.Lucien left the Prince’s office torn between duty to his ruler and an older, darker allegiance bound in blood and secrecy.
Rosethorn Folio Acquired: The ancient document listing the founding members of the covenant, including Lucien, Reginald, and the late Lady of Bath, now rests in Lucien’s personal vault.
New Ghoul Created: The Student, name pending, is now bound to Lucien and branded with his sign.
Sir Reginald’s Influence Reignited: Reginald’s manipulation and warnings hint at deeper conspiracies within the covenant.
Prince Adrien Informed: Adrien is aware of the folio’s existence but not its contents. He trusts Lucien—for now.
Humanity Check Passed: Despite predatory acts, Lucien’s remorse and tenderness preserved his soul.
Political Stakes Raised: The Rosethorn threatens to expose a web of blood oaths among London’s elite Kindred. Gothic decadence and moral decay
Love versus loyalty
Art as confession
Predation intertwined with tenderness
The weight of immortal memory

Lucien departed Prince Adrien’s office, the Rosethorn Folio locked deep within his private vault, and his mind weighed down by conflicting vows — to his Prince, his maker, and the dead Lady of Bath. Evelyn remains loyal but wary; the Student rests under his roof, slowly adapting to the blood bond.Location: The Velvet Veil, Lucien’s haven in London.
Time: The following evening.
Hunger: 2 (carried over).
Humanity: Stable (7).
Mood: Suffocating quiet before the storm; tension simmering beneath civility.The night begins with the creak of wood and whisper of velvet curtains as Lucien awakens.
Evelyn isn’t in the room — but the faint murmur of voices from below tells you you’re not alone. One is hers, firm but polite. The other, unfamiliar — a man’s voice, smooth and precise, with a foreign cadence.The smell of wet paper and incense drifts up the stairs. Someone has brought documents.Outside, the city is restless. Somewhere in the East End, a fire burns; sirens echo faintly. It’s a restless London tonight.Would you like to start with Lucien awakening and investigating the voices, or skip ahead to him already entering the parlor to meet the visitor?<br>Powered by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.chatgptexporter.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.chatgptexporter.com" target="_self">ChatGPT Exporter</a>]]></description><link>gpt-vtm/exported-text/chatgpt-vtm-v5-session-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">GPT VTM/Exported Text/ChatGPT-VTM V5 session 2.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:22:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kindred]]></title><link>vampire-clans/kindred.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Vampire Clans/Kindred.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:13:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elias Crane]]></title><description><![CDATA[Agent of <a data-href="Sir Reginald Harker" href="characters/sir-reginald-harker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Reginald Harker</a>]]></description><link>characters/elias-crane.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Characters/Elias Crane.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:10:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Victoria & Albert Museum]]></title><link>locations/the-victoria-&amp;-albert-museum.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Locations/The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:07:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dr. Sebastian Crowe]]></title><description><![CDATA[Curator of <a data-href="The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum" href="locations/the-victoria-&amp;-albert-museum.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a> (V&amp;A)]]></description><link>characters/dr.-sebastian-crowe.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Characters/Dr. Sebastian Crowe.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:07:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elysium]]></title><description><![CDATA[Elysium&nbsp;is neutral ground for the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Camarilla_(VTM)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" title="Camarilla (VTM)" href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Camarilla_(VTM)" target="_self">Camarilla</a>&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire_(WOD)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" title="Vampire (WOD)" href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire_(WOD)" target="_self">vampires</a>&nbsp;of a given city.<br>
