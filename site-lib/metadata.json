Vale","icon":"","description":"A student under <a data-href=\"Lucian Valemont\" href=\"characters/lucian-valemont.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucian Valemont</a>. Became his Ghoul in Session 2Age: 24\nMortal Occupation: Postgraduate Literature Student, King’s College London\nBackground: Born in Bath, raised in a quiet academic family. His father a historian, his mother a painter of modest repute. Adrian grew up in old houses filled with books, portraits, and dust motes — the sort of world where silence itself feels curated.Appearance:\nAdrian carries a fragile sort of beauty — pale skin touched by sleeplessness, soft dark hair that never sits quite right, and eyes of deep grey that seem to drink in the world rather than look at it. His clothes are unassuming but thoughtful: charcoal coats, scarves even when not needed, a faint trace of ink on his fingers. His posture is composed yet uncertain, as if he’s still learning how to inhabit his own body.When Lucien first sees him, there’s something familiar about him — the kind of youth Lucien once was: romantic, observant, a little haunted by beauty.Personality:\nCurious. Earnest. Too clever for his own good. Adrian is drawn to old things — books that smell of damp paper, poetry that aches with longing, men who carry the weight of centuries in their gaze. Beneath his intellect lies loneliness — a longing to belong somewhere that feels real.He speaks softly, listens intently, and asks questions that unsettle rather than flatter. When he talks about art or literature, it’s with reverence — but when he talks to Lucien, there’s a tremor of awe, as though he senses the predator behind the poet.Connection to Lucien:\nAdrian visits The Velvet Veil archive while researching 19th-century vampire symbolism in Romantic literature. Lucien, intrigued by his insight and resemblance to a long-lost muse, begins to feed him knowledge — and eventually, blood. Their connection grows from mentorship to obsession: Adrian sees Lucien as both subject and story, and Lucien sees in Adrian a reflection of the youth he lost.To Lucien, Adrian Vale becomes the living canvas — a fragile mortal touched by art, desire, and the slow corrosion of eternity.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>Adrian Vale</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Adrian_Vale**_0"}],"links":["characters/lucian-valemont.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"characters/adrian-vale.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761750204159,"modifiedTime":1761756768031,"sourceSize":2193,"sourcePath":"Characters/Adrian Vale.md","exportPath":"characters/adrian-vale.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":1,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"characters/adrian-welles.html":{"title":"Adrian Welles","icon":"","description":"Prince of the <a data-href=\"London\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">London</a> <a data-href=\"The Crimson Concord\" href=\"organisations/the-crimson-concord.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Crimson Concord</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[".html","organisations/the-crimson-concord.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"characters/adrian-welles.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761749470328,"modifiedTime":1768669327684,"sourceSize":48,"sourcePath":"Characters/Adrian Welles.md","exportPath":"characters/adrian-welles.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":2,"backlinks":["characters/elodie-rains.html","characters/lucian-valemont.html"],"type":"markdown"},"characters/adrien-valemont.html":{"title":"Adrien Valemont","icon":"","description":"Sire to <a data-href=\"Lucian Valemont\" href=\"characters/lucian-valemont.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucian Valemont</a><br>Killed by <a data-href=\"Lucian Valemont\" href=\"characters/lucian-valemont.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lucian Valemont</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["characters/lucian-valemont.html","characters/lucian-valemont.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"characters/adrien-valemont.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761749427557,"modifiedTime":1761756784031,"sourceSize":60,"sourcePath":"Characters/Adrien Valemont.md","exportPath":"characters/adrien-valemont.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":3,"backlinks":["items/the-rosethorn-folio.html","characters/lucian-valemont.html"],"type":"markdown"},"characters/dr.-sebastian-crowe.html":{"title":"Dr. Sebastian Crowe","icon":"","description":"Curator of <a data-href=\"The Victoria &amp;

Instead of punishment, Lucien was summoned. Lord Valemont saw in him something exquisite — a living muse, a sculpture of hunger and grace yet unformed.The Embrace\nThe Lord grew infatuated, blurring the lines between patron, artist, and lover. When Lucien reached his twenty-first year, Valemont whispered, “You are too perfect to fade.”\nThat night, Lucien died upon satin sheets and awoke into the Requiem — reborn by his master’s hand, not as a man, but as a masterpiece.Valemont shaped him as one might a statue: taught him the arts, the poise, the secrets of blood and brush. Yet like all art, Lucien outgrew his maker. Over decades, he came to see Valemont’s love as possession — beauty caged, desire gilded.In 1910, during the fire that consumed the Valemont Estate, Lucien disappeared into the night. The body of his master were found in the marble gallery, a smile painted upon his lips and his eyes missing.Modern Nights (Present)\nNow, Lucien Valemont lives again — an immortal Victorian aesthete in the modern age, a “modern Twink Rasputin” whose salons blur the line between enlightenment and ecstasy.\nHis haven, The Crimson Salon, is an opulent labyrinth of books, art, and pleasure. Mortals and Kindred alike gather there — poets, occultists, models, sinners — all drawn to Lucien’s promise:\n“To be remembered is to be eternal. Come, and let me paint your soul.”\nHe curates his collection of forbidden books and occult tomes, forever chasing the same question that haunted his sire — can art transcend death, or must it consume life to do so?🌹 Lucien Valemont, Caretaker of the RosethornClan: Toreador\nSire: Lord Adrien Valemont (deceased)\nTitle: The Caretaker of the Heart\nCurrent Domain: Harker Estate, London\nChronicle: Velvet Veil – The Thorns Beneath the Rose🕯️ Current StatusFollowing the death of Sir Reginald Harker and the revelations surrounding the Rosethorn Pact, Lucien Valemont assumed guardianship of the Heart and the Roses Below — the pulsing, vitae-fed roots that bind the covenant’s original oath.He does not command their power; instead, he tends to it — a penitent keeper, chosen (or cursed) to ensure the roses never fall into the hands of those who would misuse them.Each night, Lucien walks the catacombs beneath the estate — a labyrinth of brick and bone where roses bloom from walls slick with vitae.To keep them alive, he must feed them: sacrifices offered in silence, The roses whisper to him, echoing the voices of those consumed — his court of ghosts and blossoms.He paints their faces to remember them.🩸 The PenanceAt the Prince’s command, Lucien accepted a Penance Eternal. His art must now be service, his beauty a burden.In secret, he disobeys only one part of that vow: he keeps the painting — The Heart Beneath the Rose — sealed within the Velvet Veil.\nHe tells no one that it still breathes.🌹 The Rosethorn’s NatureThe Heart is not a metaphor. It is literal — a fleshy mass of vitae and root, the remnant of the First Toreador’s Heart, interwoven with thorns, pulsing faintly in the dark.\nThe Roses bloom from it, white as wax, red at the tips.\nThey thirst. They remember. They sing.Lucien’s duty is to keep their song quiet — and their hunger sated.🩸 The Penance of the RosesTo keep the roses alive, Lucien must feed them life itself. The roots beneath the Harker Estate crave breath, warmth, and the pulse of a living heart.In the catacombs below, iron reliquaries line the walls , shaped like sarcophagi, grim devices from another age, waiting in the depths beneath the Harker Estate. Within them, the vines twist and bloom, feeding not from the ground but from the warmth of the living. Those brought below are never seen again; their bodies vanish into the growth, leaving only faint echoes of voices that murmur through the petals at night.Lucien did not build them. They were already there when he inherited the duty; remnants of an ancient design meant to sustain the Heart below. He merely continues the ritual, because without it the roses would wither, and the Heart he protects would perish with them.Each offering is chosen carefully, sometimes drawn by his charm, sometimes by promise, sometimes by fate. When the hour comes, Lucien descends alone. He does not flee or turn away. He waits in the silence of the chamber, head bowed, until the last whisper fades and the roses have taken what they require. It is not cruelty that holds him there but contrition; a penance willingly endured.He paints each face afterwards, records each name. The portraits line the walls of the Velvet Veil, mute witnesses to the price of preservation. Every stroke of pigment reminds him that beauty demands blood, and that love; the kind that feeds the Pact; is always a cage.<br><img alt=\"FVnGuzwX0AAI89x.jpg\"
