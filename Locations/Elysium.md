**Elysium**: _A place for vampires to meet together without fear of harm; Usually cultural locations, such as opera houses, theaters or museums._[[1]](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Elysium_\(VTM\)#cite_note-1)

The _Elysium_ location is typically chosen by the local [Prince](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prince_\(VTM\) "Prince (VTM)") in areas of artistic or intellectual worth that promote calm reflection, such as theaters and museums, though nightclubs and even a [Kindred](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Kindred_\(VTM\) "Kindred (VTM)")'s [haven](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Haven_\(VTM\) "Haven (VTM)") may suffice.

Violence is strictly prohibited within Elysium, and individuals are expected to keep tempers in check. Any grievances between vampires are to be left outside, and the [Keeper of Elysium](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Elysium_\(VTM\)#Keeper_of_Elysium) or the [Sheriff](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Sheriff_\(VTM\) "Sheriff (VTM)") will forcibly remove those who cannot control themselves if need be. While this provides opportunity for both [neonates](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Neonate "Neonate") and [elders](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Elder "Elder") to relax, social conflict is often at its peak and what happens in Elysium can easily lead to repercussions off ground.

Though Elysiums often serve as gathering places for Kindred, the [Masquerade](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Masquerade_\(VTM\) "Masquerade (VTM)") must normally be maintained at all times for any [mortals](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Mortal_\(WOD\) "Mortal (WOD)") that may be around. Similarly, while refreshments are sometimes served, it is bad taste to come to Elysium hungry as it often leads to shorter tempers. Some Princes go so far as to forbid hunting nearby, as a concentrated population of vampires could easily result in a suspicious number of deaths in the area.
