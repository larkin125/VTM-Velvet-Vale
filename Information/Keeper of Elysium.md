Keeper of ElysiumÂ _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt_

This is a largely honorific title, though it has many practical responsibilities. The Keeper of Elysium assures that the customs of Elysium are observed, and is a caretaker of sites declared Elysium by a Prince.

It is the Keeper who may schedule or cancel any events, a position that involves both great prestige and scrutiny.
