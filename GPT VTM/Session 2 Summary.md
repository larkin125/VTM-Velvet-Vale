Session Summary

The session opened with Lucian awakening in [[The Velvet Veil]], hunger gnawing after a sleepless day haunted by memories of the previous night’s encounter with [[Grimshaw]] and the word Rosethorn. His ghoul, [[Evelyn]], brought him news of a delivery—an intended vessel for his hunger—but Lucian, weary of mind and spirit, refused to feed on a stranger. The act of restraint foreshadowed the moral and emotional conflict that would define the night.

Later, a willing donor— [[Adrian Vale]], the Student, one of Lucian’s regulars—was brought to the library. Their interaction began as an intellectual exchange on Victorian vampiric myth and ended as a dark reflection of Lucian’s own past, as he revealed himself and fed. The feeding was intimate but controlled, reaffirming his humanity rather than eroding it. The Student, enthralled and awed, became Lucian’s new ghoul, marked with his personal sigil.

Afterward, Lucian painted the youth as he slept—an act of creation and sin intertwined—and sealed his hunger in colour and canvas.

The following evening, Lucian descended into London’s museum sub-basement, where he met [[Dr. Sebastian Crowe]], the Curator of [[The Victoria & Albert Museum]] and recovered [[The Rosethorn Folio]], a set of three vellum pages bearing the signatures of long-dead (and still-undead) aristocrats, including his own and that of his former master, [[Sir Reginald Harker]]. The tense exchange was interrupted by the arrival of [[Elias Crane]], an agent of Harker’s, resulting in a standoff of old powers. Through cunning and the invocation of his lineage, Lucian claimed legal and personal ownership of the artifact.

Back home, he faced Sir Reginald himself, whose visit turned into a familiar but fraught power game. Their relationship—part devotion, part manipulation—culminated in a reminder of the elder’s control and a warning about the Rosethorn’s origins. Reginald revealed that the Lady [[Marianne of Bath]], one of the covenant’s founders, had died by her own will, seeking to sever the blood-bonded pact that still haunts them all.

Lucian did not believe him.

Drained but resolute, Lucian fed lightly from [[Evelyn]] in a moment of hunger and remorse, reaffirming his humanity with his restraint and affection. The session closed with a meeting between Lucian and Prince Adrien, his oldest friend and the ruler of London’s Kindred. Adrien, aware of the Rosethorn’s resurfacing, demanded Lucian’s loyalty—but the two shared a rare, honest exchange about their friendship, their vows, and the ghosts of their shared past.

Lucian left the Prince’s office torn between duty to his ruler and an older, darker allegiance bound in blood and secrecy.

Key Outcomes

[[The Rosethorn Folio]] Acquired: The ancient document listing the founding members of the covenant, including Lucian, Reginald, and the late Lady [[Marianne of Bath]], now rests in Lucian’s personal vault.

New Ghoul Created: The Student, [[Adrian Vale]], is now bound to Lucian and branded with his sign.

Sir Reginald’s Influence Reignited: Reginald’s manipulation and warnings hint at deeper conspiracies within the covenant.

Prince Adrien Informed: Adrien is aware of the folio’s existence but not its contents. He trusts Lucian—for now.

Humanity Check Passed: Despite predatory acts, Lucian’s remorse and tenderness preserved his soul.

Political Stakes Raised: [[The Rosethorn Pact]] threatens to expose a web of blood oaths among London’s elite Kindred.
