His ghoul, <a data-href="Evelyn" href="characters/evelyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Evelyn</a>, brought him news of a delivery—an intended vessel for his hunger—but Lucian, weary of mind and spirit, refused to feed on a stranger.

Their interaction began as an intellectual exchange on Victorian vampiric myth and ended as a dark reflection of Lucian’s own past, as he revealed himself and fed. The feeding was intimate but controlled, reaffirming his humanity rather than eroding it. The Student, enthralled and awed, became Lucian’s new ghoul, marked with his personal sigil.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Afterward, Lucian painted the youth as he slept—an act of creation and sin intertwined—and sealed his hunger in colour and canvas.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The following evening, Lucian descended into London’s museum sub-basement, where he met <a data-href="Dr. Sebastian Crowe" href="characters/dr.-sebastian-crowe.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Sebastian Crowe</a>, the Curator of <a data-href="The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum" href="locations/the-victoria-&amp;-albert-museum.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a> and recovered <a data-href="The Rosethorn Folio" href="items/the-rosethorn-folio.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Rosethorn Folio</a>, a set of three vellum pages bearing the signatures of long-dead (and still-undead) aristocrats, including his own and that of his former master, <a data-href="Sir Reginald Harker" href="characters/sir-reginald-harker.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Reginald Harker</a>.

Pre–Victorian. Closer to 1780, maybe earlier.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He hesitated, looking between his notes and the curled edge of the Rosethorn Folio resting on the desk. “But what’s strange is that there’s an additional hand… added later.

Or near enough.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A nervous laugh escaped him, uncertain whether he was trespassing on sacred ground. “It says ‘<em>Lucian Valemont, witness and eternal patron.</em>’ I know you told me you never joined them, but—well—it looks official.

Lucian—let Adrian into the private stacks as you promised. Make copies of the folio and the pages you trust no one else with. Burn what cannot be trusted. Then we trace Marianne’s last days: who visited her, who stood to gain from her death.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrian’s hands trembled a fraction with the responsibility, but he nodded. “I’ll start tonight. Grimshaw can be coaxed into trading secrets for favours—and he owes you, in his way.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Evelyn’s eyes flicked to the window, where afternoon light had started to burn the fog into distant gold. “And if Reginald moves,” she added, “we make sure you have an exit.

The house seemed to breathe with them, as if listening.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrian swallowed and finally said the thing that had been curling under his tongue since he first found the folio. “If any of this leads back to your sire,” he said slowly, looking at Lucian but not speaking for him, “we’ll find out why he put you there. And if he’s not gone—then we’ll find him too.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Evelyn’s lips pressed together. “We do this carefully,” she warned. “We gather proof, witnesses, leverage.

He stepped forward and took Lucian’s hand in both of his, squeezing once, solidly. “You have us. We’ll be careful. I promise.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Evelyn’s face hardened into its usual mask of competence, but the small, almost imperceptible tremor in her fingers betrayed that Lucian’s words had found their mark. She crossed to the mantel, producing the brass key she’d weighed earlier and handed it to Adrian with a curt nod. “The private stacks,” she said. “Late hours. No prying eyes. You keep the folio copies under lock and I keep the originals where they belong. If anyone asks, you were never given the key.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrian took the key as if it were something holy. “I’ll make copies tonight,” he said. “And digital facsimiles. I know a way to photograph vellum without damaging it—Dr. Crowe mentioned a conservator who owes him a favour. I can coax that lead loose.” He looked up, bright with purpose, suddenly older than his years. “And Grimshaw—he owes you, Lucian. I’ll go to him tonight and be careful. I’ll offer information in trade, and—” he hesitated for a breath, feeling the weight of saying something foolish and impossible, “—and I’ll come back.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Evelyn smiled once, not indulgent but approving. “Keep your promises and your mouth shut about what you find,” she said. “There are things in these pages that will want more than just our curiosity. If Reginald gets a sniff of that, we will need a diversion. You two understand how to move without being seen.” She glanced at Lucian and then, softer, added, “And if you feel the urge to tear the world down for us—don’t. Let us rather be the ones to bring it down when it must fall, deliberately.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Lucian let them make their plans while he listened, the thread of his grief and anger coiling in the hollows of his chest. When they were done, he picked up the repaired portrait with a deliberate tenderness and, without speaking, carried it to the sanctum himself. He placed it on the wall behind his bed where, even if he slept only for a few hours stolen from the long night, Evelyn’s face would be the first thing to meet his eyes. He left a small carved box beneath the frame—inside, the folio copies that he trusted least, a sacrament and a bait in one.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrian gathered his things with the solemn, fumbling care of someone stepping into a responsibility that would change him. He paused at the doorway, hand on the latch, then looked back. “We’ll be careful,” he repeated. “And if you need anything before dawn—anything at all—call and I’ll come. I owe you more than words.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Evelyn closed the door behind him and turned the lock with a click that seemed loud in the hush. She stood beside Lucian for a long moment, hand on his shoulder again, then finally drew away and moved to the window to check the street below. The afternoon deepened toward evening; the city shifted gears somewhere beyond their walls, and plans that had been only whispers began to take shape like paths through fog.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Lucian breathed in the scent of turpentine and something softer—wine, dried roses—and for the first time in a long while, allowed himself the ridiculous, fragile hope that the three of them might yet steer this thing away from the edge.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="Prompt:" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Prompt_22"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>Prompt:</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Going to sleep for a little while.

Adrian discovered that Lucian’s name was written among the founders—added hastily, on the same night of his Embrace by <strong>Lord Adrian Valemont</strong>, his sire. Lucian confessed that he had no memory of joining the Pact, realizing that his transformation and the Pact’s creation were intertwined.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Tensions rose when Adrian questioned Lucian’s humanity and the nature of the Beast. Lucian lashed out, then immediately regretted it—embracing the boy and apologizing. Their bond deepened as master and ghoul, but Lucian’s admission of what he <em>might</em> do to Adrian—"I will probably use you, like my sire used me"—cast a shadow over their closeness.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="**Act II — The Fractured Muse**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Act_II_—_The_Fractured_Muse**_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span><strong>Act II — The Fractured Muse</strong></h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After sending Adrian away in a moment of anger, Lucian destroyed his unfinished painting in a violent outburst—tearing the canvas and shattering a wine glass against it. Evelyn arrived to find the aftermath, calm and resolute as ever. Lucian, shaken by his own rage, confessed his remorse and created something new: from glass, blood, and torn canvas, he rebuilt the painting into a luminous portrait of <strong>Evelyn</strong>, a mosaic of devotion born from ruin.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He presented it to her the following morning. The refracted light made her likeness seem alive—an act of both apology and love. Evelyn, moved and uncertain, accepted the piece, sensing that it was more than art; it was confession. Their exchange reaffirmed their bond and revealed the fragile humanity that still lingered within him.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="**Act III — The Pact Tightens**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Act_III_—_The_Pact_Tightens**_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span><strong>Act III — The Pact Tightens</strong></h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the quiet after, Lucian confided in Evelyn about <strong>Marianne of Bath</strong>, who had chosen death—her own ghoul staking her at her request—to escape the Pact. He feared he was walking the same path unknowingly, caught between the secret war of <strong>Prince Adrian Welles</strong> and <strong>Sir Reginald Harker</strong>. Evelyn warned him that he might not have joined the Pact by choice, but had been <em>placed</em> within it by design—that his Embrace and the Pact’s founding were one and the same event.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Lucian admitted his dread of being forced to kill again, hinting at a past he never spoke of. Evelyn and Adrian vowed to protect him, forming a true <strong>Coterie</strong> within <em>The Velvet Veil.</em> They began to plan their next moves—Evelyn to secure the house and handle politics; Adrian to investigate <strong>Grimshaw</strong> and the museum records. Together, they agreed to uncover the Pact’s origins before Harker or the Prince moved against them.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="**Act IV — The Artist and His Hunger**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Act_IV_—_The_Artist_and_His_Hunger**_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span><strong>Act IV — The Artist and His Hunger</strong></h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Lucian spent the following days secluded in his deepest library, recording his findings in a leather-bound journal written in his personal cipher. His body weakened with hunger until, after several sleepless nights, he finally gave in—drinking bottled blood straight from the necks, mocking his own loss of refinement.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He bathed, dressed in elegance once more, and resolved to face London anew. Restored in both spirit and resolve, he prepared to attend <strong>Elysium</strong>, intent on drawing out Harker and the Prince alike through charm and deceit. For the first time in weeks, Lucian allowed himself a flicker of satisfaction—his hunger quieted, his purpose clear.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="**Session Outcomes**" dir="auto" class="heading" id="**Session_Outcomes**_1"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span><strong>Session Outcomes</strong></h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Allies Strengthened:</strong></p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul class="has-list-bullet">
