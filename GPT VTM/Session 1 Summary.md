## 🕯️ **Session Summary — “The Velvet Veil, Part I”**

### **Era & Setting:**

London, 2002 — the city’s [[Kindred]] society thrives under the shadow of Prince Adrian Welles. The nights are filled with rain, cigarette smoke, and the slow decay of the old order.

---

### **Act I — The Whispered Invitation**

Lucian, a [[Toreador]] of Victorian origin and keeper of an archive called _[[The Velvet Veil]]_, receives a summons from his former lover and now Prince, [[Adrian Welles]]. The court’s Harpy, [[Marianne of Bath]], has been found staked in her haven. Whispers of treachery ripple through Elysium.

Lucian arrives at the National Gallery, where Welles’ court holds vigil. Seneschal [[Elodie Rains]] greets him coldly, testing his composure. He deflects her probing questions about Marianne’s death with charm and wit, drawing admiration and suspicion alike.

---

### **Act II — The Nosferatu’s Secret**

In the shadows, Lucian meets his [[Nosferatu]] contact, [[Grimshaw]]. The sewer-borne informant reveals that Marianne’s last meeting wasn’t with a [[Brujah]] revolutionary in Whitechapel — but with **[[Sir Reginald Harker]]**, [[Keeper of Elysium]], in Knightsbridge.  
[[Grimshaw]] passes Lucian a bloodstained notebook recovered from [[Marianne’s haven]]. Inside, one phrase repeats: _“[[The Rosethorn Pact 1]]”_

---

### **Act III — The Prince’s Shadow**

Lucian presents the notebook to Prince Welles in private, masking his fear with devotion. The Prince is intrigued, remembering the name _Rosethorn_ from decades past. He tasks Lucian to quietly watch for any sign of the Pact, entrusting him with his **personal seal of protection** and warning him that Harker will not take kindly to such knowledge.

Lucian leaves the Prince’s alcove under the watchful eyes of the court — and Harker himself.

---

### **Act IV — The Dance of Roses and Thorns**

Lucian accepts Harker’s invitation to a secluded lounge within [[Elysium]]. What follows is a conversation laced with manipulation, attraction, and power. Lucian submits outwardly, using intimacy as his weapon. Harker probes for information about what Lucian told the Prince; Lucian gives him only fragments and half-truths.

When the meeting ends, Harker leaves behind a token — a **black pressed rose pierced with a silver pin.**

Grimshaw later identifies it as a _mark of belonging_ to the Rosethorn Pact — a symbol worn by Marianne before her death. Lucian understands the implication: he’s now publicly claimed as one of Harker’s possessions.

---

### **Act V — The Velvet Veil**

Lucian returns home through the wet streets of [[Camden]]. The rain on the windowpanes echoes the rhythm of his heartbeat. He stands before his mirror, staring at the rose on his lapel — both collar and key.

He realizes the truth of his position:  
He must serve two masters — the Prince who once loved him and the Keeper who now owns him — while walking the razor edge between their secrets.

As the city hums below, Lucian swears to himself that he’ll play both sides until he can cut the strings from them all.
